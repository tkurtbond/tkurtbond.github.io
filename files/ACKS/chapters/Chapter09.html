<h1 id="chapter-9-treasure">Chapter 9: Treasure</h1>

<p>Along with fame and derring-do, treasure is one of the primary motivations of adventuring parties.  Money is not only used to purchase new weapons, equipment, and strongholds; each gold piece worth of coins, gems, and jewelry brought safely back to civilization gives the character 1 experience point (as described in Chapter 6, <a href="Chapter06.html#earning-experience-from-adventures">Earning Experience from Adventures</a>. In most campaigns, experience from treasure recovered from dungeons or the wilderness will be the main source of character level advancement.</p>

<p>Magic items are the other, even more alluring element of treasure hoards. While characters are not awarded experience points for recovering and keeping magic items, they are highly sought-after nonetheless, as they grant bonuses and special abilities that can give parties a survival edge when they venture into ever more dangerous locations and face mightier monsters.</p>

<h2 id="random-treasure-generation">Random Treasure Generation</h2>

<p>Treasure will usually be found in the lairs of monsters. Each monster entry in Chapter 8, <a href="Chapter08.html#chapter-8-monsters">Monsters</a>, designates whether or not that type of monster has the possibility of treasure. Those that do are given a Treasure Type (TT), which indicates what kinds and quantities of treasure a monster might have.</p>

<p>The Treasure Types are lettered from A to R, with TT A yielding the smallest hoards and TT R the largest. To randomly generate a monster’s treasure, the Judge finds the row on the <a href="Chapter09.html#treasure-type-table">Treasure Type</a> table that corresponds to the monster’s TT. For each column on the row, the Judge rolls the appropriate dice to determine whether the specified treasure is present, and if so, in what quantity. When the dice indicate that gems, jewelry, or magic items are present, the specific treasures found in these categories are then determined using sub-tables provided after the <a href="Chapter09.html#treasure-type-table">Treasure Types</a> table. If the presence of magic items is indicated, but no specific type is indicated, the type is determined by rolling on the <a href="Chapter09.html#random-magic-type">Random Magic Type</a> table. Judges wishing to create more diverse and interesting treasures may then combine the treasure generated into lots and use the Special Treasures table, as described below.</p>

<p>The <a href="Chapter09.html#treasure-type-table">Treasure Type</a> table is designed to place a total amount of treasure in any given lair or dungeon equal to four times the XP value of the monsters in the area. Thus, on average, the amount of treasure assigned to a monster by its Treasure Type equals four times its XP. However, there is a correction factor that compensates for encounters with monsters that have no treasure by assigning other types of monsters more treasure. For example, in a dungeon level 2 stocked with the default random monster tables, over half the encounters will be with monsters like zombies and giant bats that do not carry treasure. The remaining dungeon level 2 monsters that do carry treasure therefore have been assigned treasure worth eight times their XP value. In this way, the overall gp to XP ratio within that set of monsters remains approximately 4:1.</p>

<p>In addition to their quantitative rank, the Treasure Types are further sub-divided into three categories, representing the method by which the monsters have accumulated the treasure: by hoarding, by raiding, or incidentally. Hoarding monsters are typically intelligent enough to appreciate the value of wealth, and powerful enough to gain and defend substantial amounts of it. Hoarder Treasure Types (B, D, H, N, Q, R) feature a roughly equal mix of coins and other valuables, and typically yield values far in excess of their weight (usually 10 stone or less).</p>

<p>Raiding monsters are intelligent creatures who gather treasure by stealing it from those weaker than themselves. Raiders are often the minions of more powerful monster who claim the most precious items for themselves, so Raider Treasure Types (E, G, J, L, O) are mostly bulky hoards (typically 20 stone) of low value coin and goods.</p>

<p>Monsters with incidental treasure accumulate wealth accidentally, e.g. by bringing dead adventurers back to the lair to feed their young. Though they may lack the intelligence to recognize things of value, they may be attracted to shiny objects which they gather as best they can with their claws or jaws. The Incidental Treasure Types (A, C, F, I, K, M, P) are usually only a few stone in weight and are the most variable type of treasure, with some rolls on these tables yielding fantastic bounty while as many others produce nothing at all.</p>

<p>A dungeon with a variety of monsters will thus tend to have a wide assortment of interesting treasures, ranging from precious regalia to bulky low value coin.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, randomly generated treasures are found only in the monster’s lair. If the monster entry specifies that a creature carries individual treasure either instead of or in addition to its lair treasure, these individual treasures may be found even if the monster is encountered when wandering outside its lair.</p>

<h2 id="planned-treasure-generation">Planned Treasure Generation</h2>

<p>The Judge is never required to roll for treasure, and there will be many cases where random treasure generation is not the best method to employ. Treasure should be placed by hand, or random treasures amended, whenever necessary given the Judge’s plans for his campaign and adventures. Important treasures should always be placed by the Judge deliberately; for example, a magic item crafted by a major antagonist should be tailored to the antagonist’s personality and role in the campaign.</p>

<p>When creating a dungeon or other adventure area, one easy way to generate treasure is to calculate the sum of all XP from monsters in the area, and then choose a Treasure Type whose average value is close to four times this sum. If the category of this treasure table (hoarder, raider, or incidental) does not seem appropriate to the area, the Judge should instead choose a Treasure Type from the appropriate category that has the closest average value. The Judge should then randomly generate treasure for the area using the selected table. Because probabilities are involved, the result may not match the desired value. If the outcome is too much treasure, the Judge can add more monsters or remove some treasure. If too little treasure results, the Judge can make up the difference with special treasures placed by hand. It is also fine to go with high or low results; over time, the law of averages will assert itself.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: An underground crypt has been stocked with 20 skeletons (13 XP each), 1 wight (110 XP), 4 giant vampire bats (20 XP each) and 7 pit vipers (40 XP each), for a total of 730 XP. The crypt treasure should be around four times that total (4 x 730), or 2,920gp. This is close to the 3,250gp average value of Treasure Type I. Treasure Type I is an incidental type treasure, which seems appropriate for the crypt’s burial goods. Using row I on the <a href="Chapter09.html#treasure-type-table">Treasure Type</a> table, the Judge rolls 2,000 silver pieces and 5 pieces of jewelry, and places some of this treasure in the coffins guarded by the undead and the rest on the corpse of a bandit at the bottom of a pit trap.</p>

<p>It is always up to the Judge to decide how much treasure he wishes to allow into the campaign. The amount of treasure allowed in the campaign will directly control the speed at which the adventurers level, as well as their overall power and capabilities. The Judge should not allow the dice to trump good sense or ruin careful dungeon design.</p>

<h3 id="gems">Gems</h3>

<p>When gems are found, the Judge may roll to determine their value in gold pieces on the <a href="Chapter09.html#gem-value">Gem Value</a> table. All gems may be assigned the same value, they may be given individual values, or they may be divided up into groups and given different values. The average value of gems is 200gp per stone.</p>

<p>Gems appearing in a treasure hoard may be specified to be ornamentals or brilliants. Ornamentals have a value between 10 - 50gp (average 30), and may be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Brilliants are between 500 - 10,000gp (average 4,000), and are generated by rolling 1d100 + 80. The <a href="Chapter09.html#treasure-type-table">Treasure Type</a> table uses the most valuable gems to minimize the number of rolls on the gem sub-table for Judges who are randomizing each separately; those who wish a hoard consisting of more lower value gems may convert each brilliant to 11 gems, and each gem to 7 ornamentals.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: The Judge’s results for TT Q indicate that 3 brilliants are present in a hoard. Seeing that their average value is 5,000gp each, the Judge could actually place this 15,000gp in gems as one 10,000gp flawless blue diamond, three 1,000gp rubies, four 250gp pearls, and ten 10gp quartz crystals, or any other combination desired.</p>

<h3 id="jewelry">Jewelry</h3>

<p>Jewelry can vary in value in a similar manner to gems. The <a href="Chapter09.html#jewelry-value">Jewelry Value</a> table can be rolled on to determine the value of each individual piece of jewelry. The average value of jewelry is 1,000gp per piece.</p>

<p>Jewelry appearing in a treasure hoard may be specified to be trinkets or regalia. Trinkets have values of 2-800gp (average 225), and are generated using 2d20 on the chart below. Regalia values range from 1,000-80,000gp (average 12,000) and can be generated using 1d100 + 80. The treasure charts give jewelry treasures using the most valuable unit of jewelry for the convenience of randomizing each one separately; Judges wishing to use average values to generate a larger quantity of jewelry may convert each piece of regalia to 12 pieces of jewelry, each of which may be in turn converted to four trinkets.</p>

<h3 id="special-treasures">Special Treasures</h3>

<p>Not all treasure should be coin, gems, and jewelry. Ancient cities might hold terracotta pottery or rare dyes and pigments. The tombs of ancient kings might have trinkets of carved ivory. Goblin raiders might have captured spices, silk, or rare furs. These items are called special treasures.</p>

<p>Judges should note that many of the items appearing as special treasures are designed to be congruent with the types of merchandise appearing on the <a href="Chapter07.html#merchandise-tables">Merchandise</a> table in Chapter 7, <a href="Chapter07.html#mercantile-ventures">Mercantile Ventures</a>. Players who are not interested in using the arbitrage trading system described in that chapter to maximize the return they achieve from selling special treasures are under no obligation to do so. The value listed for the special treasure is its base value as a trade good, and in general it can be sold for that amount without further thought. However, the Judge is within his rights to decide that a special treasure sells for less, or cannot be sold at all, in a market where the demand for that type of merchandise is low. And players may be inspired to pursue mercantile ventures after observing a merchants’ barely-disguised glee when they sell a special treasure for its base value in a market where demand is high!</p>

<p>To include special treasures in a hoard, first calculate the treasure normally and divide it into lots: 1 piece of jewelry, 1 gem, or 1,000 coins is a lot. Then roll on the table below for each lot of coin, gems, and jewelry and substitute the special treasure rolled for that lot of coin, gems, or jewelry.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: A Type L treasure is rolled consisting of 4,000cp; 3,000sp; and 4 pieces of jewelry. This yields 4 lots of copper, 3 lots of silver, and 4 lots of jewelry. Rolling for the copper lots, the Judge gets a “2”, “9”, “16”, and “15”. Three copper lots stay as coin, while one is replaced by 1d3 barrels of preserved meat. Rolling for the silver lots, the Judge gets a “7”, “10”, and “20”, and replaces one of the three lots with 1d3 sacks of loose tea. Further rolls indicate that 2 pieces of jewelry become rich fur capes. The Judge makes further sub-rolls, and the final treasure is 3,000cp; 2,000sp; 1 barrel of preserved meat (10gp, 16 stone); 2 sacks of loose tea (75gp, 5 stone each); 2 pieces of jewelry worth 1,100gp each; and 2 rich fur capes worth 700gp and 1,300gp respectively.</p>

<h3 id="scavenging-treasure">Scavenging Treasure</h3>

<p>Poor or low level adventurers may be so desperate for treasure that they scavenge weapons, armor, or other equipment rotting in dungeons, littering old battlefields, or equipping slain foes. These items are almost universally in bad repair. Roll 1d20 on the following tables to determine the condition and value of any equipment scavenged. Effects are cumulative.</p>

<p>Damage penalties cannot reduce weapon damage to less than 1 point. Armor Class or attack throw penalties cannot be worse than -5. Weapons and equipment susceptible to breaks will be destroyed if the character rolls an unmodified 1 when using the item.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: Marcus scavenges a sword from an ancient battlefield. He rolls a 19, and must roll twice more. He rolls a 7 and 15. The sword has a rusty blade and loose hilt, and imposes penalties of -1 damage and -1 initiative. Its value is reduced 40%, to 6gp, when he tries to sell it.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-and-using-magic-items">Identifying and Using Magic Items</h2>

<p>Most magic items are not labeled, so characters will not know the exact properties of magic items except through research or trial and error (e.g. sipping a potion, using a sword in combat, etc.) Sages and other characters proficient in Magical Engineering or Loremastery can identify common or famous magical items simply through their knowledge of such things. Potions may be identified by sipping them, or by consulting an alchemist. Otherwise, an arcane spellcaster of 9th level or greater can identify a magic item using Magic Research.</p>

<p>In order to use a magic item, a character must follow any procedures indicated in the item’s description. Some magic items are always in effect, but others may require special actions or concentration. Some magic items have limited uses, called “charges.” When items have charges, each charge can be spent for one instance of magical effect. A character will not know how many charges an item has unless he identified the item with Magic Research. When the charges are all spent the item becomes useless and non-magical.</p>

<h2 id="magic-item-descriptions">Magic Item Descriptions</h2>

<h3 id="potions-1">Potions</h3>

<p>Although potions can be found in a variety of types of containers, including glass, ceramic, or metal flasks, most contain only one dose that imbues their potion’s particular effects for one individual. Most potions bear no label and require a small amount to be sampled in order to attempt to identify the potion type. This is not without error, however, because potions of the same type may differ in their aroma or taste depending on how they were made.</p>

<p>Drinking a potion takes one round. Potions take effect in the same round as their consumption, and last for 1d6+6 turns. This general principle is superseded where the specific potion description indicates otherwise. If a character drinks a potion while another potion is in effect, the character will be sickened and unable to take any actions for 3 turns (30 minutes); neither potion will have any other affect.</p>

<p><strong>Animal Control</strong>: This potions grants the drinker the ability to control up to 3d6 Hit Dice of normal or giant animals within 60’ as if using a charm monster spell. Humans, demi-humans, humanoids, and fantastic creatures such as griffons or wyverns cannot be controlled by this potion. The drinker may decide which individual creatures out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess Hit Dice of effect are ignored. At least one creature will always be affected. Intelligent animals may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs, but unintelligent animals receive no saving throw. Unintelligent animals will be completely under the drinker’s control. Intelligent animals can be given orders, subject to the normal limitations of charm effects. When the control ends, unintelligent animals will be afraid and leave the area if they can. Intelligent animals will be hostile. Clairaudience: This potion grants the drinker the ability to hear up to 60’ by means of the ears of a creature in the area, functioning similarly to the spell clairvoyance. A lead barrier between the drinker and the creature will block the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Clairvoyance</strong>: This potion grants the drinker the ability to see up to 60’ by means of the eyes of a creature in the area, as the spell of the same name. A lead barrier between the drinker and the creature will block the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Climbing</strong>: The drinker gains the ability to climb sheer surfaces without the aid of any equipment. A proficiency throw of 2+ on 1d20 is required per 100’ of climbing, at least once per climb.</p>

<p><strong>Delusion</strong>: This potion is aptly named, for it convinces the drinker that the potion is of another type. If more than one person tastes this potion, there is a 90% chance they all will believe the potion to be of the same type. For example, a potion of clairaudience might convince the drinker there are sounds in the distance that do not truly exist.</p>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong>: This potion shrinks the imbiber and everything he carries to 6 inches tall. If the character remains motionless, he can avoid being spotted with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. The character can only attack creatures smaller than 1’ for normal damage; larger opponents take only 1 hp from any hit. This potion will cancel a potion of growth without ill effect.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon Control</strong>: This potion grants the drinker the power to control one dragon within 60’ as if using a charm monster spell. The dragon may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs. A controlled dragon will do whatever is commanded of it, subject to the normal limits of charm monster (e.g. it will not harm itself). A controlled dragon will be hostile when the control ends.</p>

<p><strong>ESP</strong>: This potion grants the imbiber a spell-like ability the equivalent of the arcane spell ESP. The drinker may “hear” the thoughts (if any) of a creature within 60’ by concentrating for one full turn in one direction. The ESP may penetrate up to 2 feet of rock, but a lead barrier between the drinker and the creature will block the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Extra-Healing</strong>: Imbibing the full dose of this potion will heal 3d6+3 points of damage. Unlike most other potions, this potion can be imbibed in three separate, equal portions for the benefit of 1d6+1 hit points of healing per one-third of the potion.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Resistance</strong>: The imbiber of this potion is impervious to all forms of ordinary flame. Further, this potion grants a bonus of +2 saving throws versus fire attacks, and reduces damage from magical or dragon fire by -1 per die of damage, to a minimum of 1 point per die.</p>

<p><strong>Flying</strong>: This potion grants the imbiber a spell-like ability equivalent to the arcane spell fly. The drinker may fly at up to 120’ per round for the duration of the spell.</p>

<p><strong>Gaseous Form</strong>: The creature who quaffs this potion takes on the form of a translucent cloud of gas. Anything the user is carrying or wearing immediately falls to the floor. While in gaseous form, a creature cannot attack, but it can move at 30 feet per round and can flow below doors and other small spaces that are not sealed airtight. A gaseous creature has an AC of 11, and is immune to non-magical weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Giant Control</strong>: When imbibed, the drinker is able to control one giant within 60’ as if using a charm monster spell. The giant may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs. The controlled giant will do whatever is commanded of it, subject to the normal limits of charm monster. A controlled giant will be hostile when the control ends.</p>

<p><strong>Giant Strength</strong>: The imbiber of this potion temporarily becomes as strong as a hill giant. The wearer attacks as an 8 HD monster or as his own class and level, whichever is better, and the character inflicts double normal damage with his attacks. The character also can throw rocks at opponents to a distance of 200’ for 3d6 points of damage and gains a +16 bonus to force open doors. The strength bonuses of this potion may not be combined with any other magical effects that influence strength, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength - a weak character who drinks this potion has the strength of a weak giant, while a very strong character would gain the strength of a very strong giant!</p>

<p><strong>Growth</strong>: The imbiber of this potion doubles in size. Strength increases proportionately, so that all damage dealt is doubled and the character gains a +16 bonus to force open doors. (A giant who drinks a growth potion is very fearsome…)</p>

<p><strong>Healing</strong>: Like the divine spell cure light wounds, imbibing this potion will heal 1d6+1 points of damage or will cure paralysis.</p>

<p><strong>Heroism</strong>: Only an assassin, dwarven vaultguard, elven spellsword, explorer, or fighter may use this potion. Extra levels and their accompanied benefits to combat are temporarily granted to the imbiber, determined by his experience level as shown in the table below. Note that extra hit points granted due to the level increase are subtracted first when the character is wounded.</p>

<p><strong>Human Control</strong>: Once this potion is quaffed, the drinker is able to control up to 3d6 Hit Dice of humans, demi-humans, and humanoids within 60’ as if using a charm monster spell (normal men count as 1/2 Hit Die each). The targets may resist the effect with a successful saving throw versus Staffs. The controlled creatures will do whatever is commanded of them, subject to the normal limits of charm monster. and the controlled creatures will be hostile when the control ends.</p>

<p><strong>Invisibility</strong>: When this potion is quaffed, the drinker is bestowed with the spell-like ability of invisibility. When the character becomes invisible, all the items carried and worn by that character also become invisible. Items become visible once again when they leave the character’s possession. This potion can be consumed in 1/6 increments, in which case the invisibility granted lasts 1 turn per dose. Any combat action removes the invisibility, such that a new dose must be consumed.</p>

<p><strong>Invulnerability</strong>: An invulnerability potion gives the drinker +2 to all saving throws and Armor Class. However, if a potion of invulnerability is quaffed more than once per week, the potion has the opposite effect, causing a penalty of -2 to saving throws and Armor Class!</p>

<p><strong>Levitation</strong>: When this potion is quaffed, the drinker is bestowed with the spell-like ability of levitation. The drinker may move up or down 20’ per round without any support. The potion does not enable the drinker to move horizontally, but the user could levitate to a ceiling and move sideways by using his hands at 60’ per round.</p>

<p><strong>Longevity</strong>: This potion makes the drinker 10 years younger. This restored youth is possible not only for natural aging, but also for aging from magic or creature effects. Age cannot be reduced below 15 (or mid-adolescence for creatures other than humans). There is some small danger however, since each time a potion of longevity is consumed there is a cumulative 1% probability that all previous age reversals from potions of this type will be negated, raising the character’s age to the age he would be without the effects of the potions.</p>

<p><strong>Oil of Sharpness</strong>: This potion resembles the dark oil used to clean arms and armor. When applied to the blade of an edged or pointed weapon, it temporarily enhances it to the equivalent of a magic weapon +1. Weapons that are already enchanted gain an additional +1 while oiled. If drunk, the oil serves only to give the imbiber flatulence for several hours. A single vial contains enough to coat 20 arrows, 2 one-handed weapons, or one two-handed weapon. The oil will evaporate 8 hours after it is applied.</p>

<p><strong>Oil of Slipperiness</strong>: This oil is applied to the character much the same way as oil of sharpness is applied to weapons. Any character so coated cannot be restrained or grabbed, wrapped in the grip of constrictor snakes, or otherwise subject to any other grasping attacks, including binding ropes, chains, or cuffs, magical or otherwise. Simply put, nothing can get a grip on a character coated in this oil. Further, objects can be coated with the oil. A signle vial contains enough to coat 20 arrows, 2 one-handed weapons, one two-handed weapon, or one 10’ x 10’ patch of floor. Any object subject to the spell is virtually impossible to grasp, and characters must make an attack throw versus Armor Class 10 each round to grab or maintain their grip on such objects. If a floor is coated, any individual moving or even standing on the floor must make a proficiency throw of 20+ each round or fall down. The effects of the oil last 8 hours, but the oil can be cleaned off early with liquid containing alcohol, such as whiskey, wine, or stout beer.</p>

<p><strong>Philter of Love</strong>: The imbiber of this potion becomes charmed by the next creature he lays eyes upon. Furthermore, if the creature is of similar racial stock and belongs to the drinker’s preferred sex, the drinker will become deeply enamored with it. The charm aspect of this potion lasts for 6+1d6 turns, but only dispel magic will make the drinker cease to be enamored by a member of a preferred sex.</p>

<p><strong>Plant Control</strong>: The imbiber of a potion of plant control is able to control plants or plant-like creatures (including fungi and molds) within an area of 30’ x 30’ to a range of 60’. Intelligent plant-like creatures may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs, but unintelligent plants receive no saving throw. The controlled plants will obey the user’s will, and even if the plant is not normally mobile, the potion grants the ability to make the plants move. For instance, vines can be controlled to twist, writhe, and wrap around targets in the area. Intelligent plant-like creatures can be given orders, subject to the normal limitations of charm monster, but will be hostile when the control ends.</p>

<p><strong>Poison</strong>: Poison always appears like a normal magic potion, but if any amount is ingested, even a sip, the imbiber must save versus Poison or die. Poison is also fatal if applied to open wounds. A poison potion can be used to envenom twenty missiles (arrows, bolts, or darts) or one melee weapon. See the <a href="Chapter10.html#poisons">Poisons</a> section in Chapter 10 for more information on using poison.</p>

<p><strong>Polymorph (self)</strong>: This potion grants its imbiber the ability to polymorph himself into a new form. Apart from its duration, it is otherwise identical to the arcane spell of the same name.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong>: This potion grants the character who drinks it the ability to move twice as fast and make double the normal number of attacks per round. This heightened ability does not come without cost, for the strain it puts on the imbiber’s body ages him by 1 year permanently (dwarves age 2 years, while elves age 5 years).</p>

<p><strong>Super-Heroism</strong>: Only assassins, dwarven vaultguards, elven spellswords, explorers, and fighters may use this potion. Extra levels and their accompanied benefits to combat are temporarily granted to the imbiber, determined by his or her experience level as shown in the table below. In all other respects this potion is identical to heroism.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Water</strong>: This sweet-tasting liquid can be used to cleanse water (including turning saltwater into fresh water) or otherwise transform poisons, acid, and other non-potables into drinkable liquid. Further, sweet water will destroy other potions. For most liquids, this potion will affect up to 100,000 feet cubed. However, only 1,000 feet cubed of acid can be neutralized. The effects of sweet water are permanent, and once treated, liquid will resist spoilage or contamination for 5d4 rounds. After this time it can be contaminated once again.</p>

<p><strong>Treasure Finding</strong>: The imbiber of this potion may, by concentrating for one turn, sense the direction and distance of the most valuable treasure within 360’. In order to be detected, the total value of the treasure must meet or exceed a value of 50gp. No physical barrier will impede detection, with the exception of some magical wards or lead.</p>

<p><strong>Undead Control</strong>: Normally, undead are immune to charm effects. However, when this potion is quaffed, the drinker is able to control up to 3d6 Hit Dice of undead of 4 HD or fewer, or one undead creature of more than 4 HD, as if using a charm monster spell. Intelligent undead may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Spells, but unintelligent undead receive no saving throw. Unintelligent undead will be completely under the drinker’s control and will obey the user’s will entirely. Intelligent undead can be given orders, subject to the normal limitations of charm monster. Controlled undead will be hostile when the control ends. The undead will be hostile when the control ends.</p>

<p><strong>Water Breathing</strong>: The imbiber of this potion is granted the ability to breathe in lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water at any depth, as the arcane spell of the same name. The potion lasts for 4 hours.</p>

<h3 id="rings-1">Rings</h3>

<p>All magical rings are usable by any character class. They must be worn on a digit of the hands only (fingers or thumb). It is only possible to wear two magical rings; if more than two are worn all of the rings do not function.</p>

<p><strong>Command Animal</strong>: The wearer of this ring may command giant and/or normal-sized animals within 60’. Animals totaling 6 Hit Dice can be commanded Humans, demi-humans, humanoids, and fantastic creatures are not affected. Intelligent animals may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Wands, but unintelligent animals receive no saving throw. The animals will respond to the caster’s will and do whatever is commanded of them. The effect lasts so long as concentration is maintained, and the wearer can take no other actions while concentrating. Once control ends, the animals will not be well disposed to the ring wearer, and any reaction rolls suffer a penalty of -1. The ring may be used once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Command Human</strong>: This ring grants the wearer the ability to command humans, demi-humans, and/or humanoids up to 60’ away. Humans totaling 6 Hit Dice can be commanded (0th level humans are treated as half of a Hit Die for this calculation). The targets may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Wands. The commanded creatures will respond to the caster’s will and do whatever is commanded of them.The effect lasts so long as concentration is maintained, and the user can take no other actions while concentrating. Once control ends, commanded creatures will not be well disposed to the ring wearer, and any reaction rolls suffer a penalty of -1. The ring may be used once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Command Plant</strong>: The ring wearer can control plants and plant-like creatures within a 10’ x 10’ area up to 60’ away. Intelligent plant-like creatures may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs, but unintelligent plants receive no saving throw. The controlled plants will obey the user’s will, and even if the plant is not normally mobile, the potion grants the ability to make the plants move. The effect lasts so long as concentration is maintained, and the wearer can take no other actions while concentrating. Intelligent plants will be hostile when the control ends. The ring may be used once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Delusion</strong>: This cursed ring convinces the wearer that the ring is of another type. The Judge could decide randomly which kind of ring the wear believes this ring to be, or one might be chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Djinni Calling</strong>: This powerful ring can be used once per week to summon a djinni. The djinni will serve and obey the character that summoned it, regardless of whether he is wearing the ring. The djinni will serve for up to one day at a time before returning to its plane of existence. If the djinni is ever slain, the ring is worthless.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Resistance</strong>: The ring wearer is impervious to all forms of ordinary flame. Further, the ring grants a bonus of +2 saving throws versus fire attacks, and reduces damage from magical or dragon fire by -1 per die of damage, to a minimum of 1 point per die.</p>

<p><strong>Invisibility</strong>: Once each turn, this ring grants the wearer the ability to become invisible, as the spell invisibility.</p>

<p><strong>Protection</strong>: This ring has several different power levels. For each “+”, the ring will increase the wearer’s AC by this amount, and grant the wearer this bonus to all saving throws. For example, if a character with an AC of 0 is wearing a ring of protection +2, his AC becomes 2 and all saving throws are rolled with a +2 bonus. When a ring of protection is found, roll on the table below to determine which kind.</p>

<p>Where a radius is given, all creatures within the radius of the ring gain its bonus to saving throws. Only the wearer of the ring gains the ring’s bonus to Armor Class.</p>

<p><strong>Regeneration</strong>: This ring grants the wearer the ability to regenerate 1 hp per round. The ring will also regenerate body parts lost to injury. Small pieces, like fingers, take 1 day to grow back. Larger pieces, such as a limb, may take 1 week to grow back. Only damage taken while the character was wearing the ring can be regenerated. Further, the ring is powerless to regenerate damage caused by acid or fire, and the ring will not function if the wearer’s hit points drop to 0 or less.</p>

<p><strong>Spell Storing</strong>: When this ring is found, it will contain 1d6 arcane or divine spells of any level, selected or determined randomly by the Judge. When a character puts the ring on, he automatically gains the knowledge of which spells are already stored, and may cast them as if a spellcaster of the minimum level required to cast the spell. The ring’s spells may be recharged by having a spellcaster cast the replacement spells directly at the ring, but the ring will hold only the spells it had when found - the exact spells may not be changed. The ring does not absorb spells cast at its wearer.</p>

<p><strong>Spell Turning</strong>: This ring reflects 2d6 spells back against their casters, leaving the wearer unaffected by the spell. Only spells are affected, not monster powers or magical effects which aren’t spells. Once the maximum number of spells is reached, the ring becomes useless.</p>

<p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: This ring grants the wearer the ability to move up to 20 stone (200lb) of weight with his mind, as the spell telekinesis. However, there is no limited duration when using the ring.</p>

<p><strong>Water Walking</strong>: Any character wearing this ring can walk on water as if it were solid, dry land.</p>

<p><strong>Weakness</strong>: This is a cursed ring, and once put on it can be removed only with a remove curse spell. Over the course of 6 rounds, the wearer’s STR drops to 3 and all attacks and damage are rolled with a penalty of -3 (minimum of 1 point of damage is dealt).</p>

<p><strong>Wishes</strong>: A variable number of wishes (1d4) are granted to the wearer of this ring. The wishes function as the ritual spell of the same name, and can be used at any time. Once the wishes are used the ring becomes non-magical.</p>

<p><strong>X-Ray Vision</strong>: One time per turn, the wearer of this ring can see through a stone wall and up to 30’. The wearer may see 60’ if looking through wood and other low-density material. A 10’ squared area (100 square feet) can be visually examined each turn, and any secret doors, hidden recesses, or traps will be evident. This activity takes full concentration. Lead or gold will block x-ray vision.</p>

<h3 id="scrolls-1">Scrolls</h3>

<p>Most scrolls are pieces of parchment, imbued with the magical writings of a spell or other magical effect. These writings are potent in that they simply require the pronunciation of their words to release their power. Scrolls are usually written in obscure or dead languages. The Judge may choose the language in which the scroll is written, or roll on the table below.</p>

<p>A character must be able to read the language in which the scroll is written in order to use the scroll. An arcane spellcaster can use read languages to be able to use a scroll in an unfamiliar language. Some scrolls can be used by any character that can read them, while other scrolls have additional restrictions on their use beyond being able to read the language. These will be discussed below.</p>

<h4 id="scroll-of-spells">Scroll of Spells</h4>

<p>A scroll of spells will be found with 1 to 7 spells written on it. About 3/4 of all spell scrolls contain spells from the arcane spell list, and the remaining contain spells drawn from the divine spell lists. Characters can only cast a spell from a scroll if the spell is on their class list. A spell may be cast even if it is not normally usable by a spellcaster of the reader’s level. These spells are cast as if from a spell caster of the minimum level required to cast the spell. Once a spell is cast from a scroll, the magical writing for that spell disappears.</p>

<p>When determining the contents of a scroll of spells, roll first to determine the type of spells by class, then roll to determine the spell level of each spell.</p>

<h4 id="cursed-scroll">Cursed Scroll</h4>

<p>A cursed scroll inflicts a horrible curse upon the reader. The Judge has considerable flexibility in determining the effects of the curse. A curse may only be removed with the spell remove curse. The Judge might also allow the curse to be lifted if the character performs a special quest. Some possible curses are provided below, but any similar curse might be used instead.</p>

<h4 id="scrolls-of-warding">Scrolls of Warding</h4>

<p>A scroll of warding can be used by any character that can read it. When the magical words of warding are read aloud, the words disappear from the page and the reader is surrounded by a 10’ radius area of protection against the type of creature indicated by the scroll. This area of protection is centered on the reader, and moves wherever he moves. This protective barrier stops the creature type from entering, but not from attacking with missile weapons or spells. The circle of protection will last until the reader dismisses it, or if anyone within the circle attempts to melee with a creature of the type protected against.</p>

<p><strong>Ward against Elementals</strong>: A ward against elementals scroll wards against all elementals for 2 turns, subject to the rules governing warding scrolls.</p>

<p><strong>Ward against Lycanthropes</strong>: For 6 turns, a ward against lycanthropes scroll wards against all lycanthrope forms. The protective barrier can repel a certain number of lycanthropes, based on their number of HD. If the lycanthropes have 3 or fewer Hit Dice, 1d10 of their number will be repelled. If they have 4 or 5 HD, 1d8 of their number will be repelled. If the lycanthropes have 6 HD or above, then 1d4 of their number are repelled.</p>

<p><strong>Ward against Magic</strong>: A barrier is created against all spells and spell-like effects from magical items or monsters. This barrier remains for 1d4 turns, during which time no spells or spell-like effects may enter or leave the protected area. This effect cannot be dispelled or otherwise removed except through a wish.</p>

<p><strong>Ward against Undead</strong>: For 6 turns, a ward against undead scroll wards against all forms of undead. The protective barrier can repel a certain number of undead, based on their number of HD. If they have 3 or fewer Hit Dice, 2d12 of their number will be repelled. If they have 4 or 5 HD, 2d6 of their number will be repelled. If the undead have 6 HD or above, then 1d6 of their number are repelled.</p>

<p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong>: A treasure map can be used by any character that can read it. Treasure maps vary considerably in the value of treasure they lead to. In all cases, the Judge will construct the map and the treasure it leads to ahead of time. The map might lead to a treasure within the dungeon the characters find the map, or the map may lead to another, sometimes remote, location. The difficulty of attaining the treasure should be proportional to its value. There may be traps, riddles, or other challenges. The map itself may be in an unusual language, or enchanted or encrypted such that it requires read languages to decipher.</p>

<h3 id="rods-staffs-and-wands-1">Rods, Staffs, and Wands</h3>

<p>Rods are sometimes usable by any class, but many are restricted to use by certain classes only. Wands are only usable by arcane spellcasters such as mages or elven spellswords. A staff may be usable by either arcane or divine spellcasters, depending on the kind of staff. When a class-restricted item is described, the name of the item will be followed by either “D” if it is usable by a divine spellcaster, “A” if it is usable by arcane spellcasters, and “AD” if usable by both.</p>

<p>Each of these magic items generally uses a “charge” when its effect is triggered, and each item has a limited number of charges. When found, a rod will contain 2d6 charges, a staff will contain 3d10 charges, and a wand will contain 2d10 charges. Exceptions will be noted in specific item descriptions. Physically, these three types of magic items differ primarily in size. Wands are small and thin, being about 18 inches long. A staff is much larger, being 6’ long and generally has a 2” diameter. Rods are somewhere in-between these two kinds of items, being about 3’ long.</p>

<p><strong>Rod of Cancellation</strong>: This item is highly feared by those who value their magic items, for with but one touch of this rod, a magic item permanently loses all of its power and becomes an ordinary item. When attempting to strike an item on an opponent, treat the attack as if it needs to hit an AC of 0. The Judge, depending on the circumstances, may adjust this value. This rod is usable once and may not be recharged.</p>

<p><strong>Rod of Resurrection [D]</strong>: A cleric or other divine spellcaster of any level may use this rod one time per day to raise beings from the dead as the resurrection ritual spell. The caster using this rod does not need to rest after expending charges from the rod. Different kinds of characters may be resurrected, and each type requires a different number of charges. When all charges from the rod are used, it crumbles into dust.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Commanding [D]</strong>: This staff may be used to command plants, animals, and humans in the same manner as the rings command animal, command human, and command plant. Each use requires one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Healing [D]</strong>: This staff does not employ charges. It heals any creature touched 1d6+1 hit points. The staff can only be used one time per creature per day, but may heal an unlimited number of creatures in a day.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Power [A]</strong>: This powerful staff has several abilities. First, it can be used to cast the spells cone of cold, lightning bolt, and fireball (each dealing 8d6 points of damage). In addition, the staff may be used to cast continual light and telekinesis (with a weight limit of 25 stone). Finally, this staff can also be used with the same effect as a staff of striking.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Striking [D]</strong>: This staff strikes as a staff +1. With the expenditure of one charge and a successful attack roll, this staff can be used to strike an opponent for 2d6+1 points of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Withering [D]</strong>: This staff functions as a staff +1 that deals 2d6+1 points of damage when a charge is used. By using 2 charges and successfully striking an opponent, the staff ages a victim by 10 years. If three charges are spent in this attack, one of the victim’s limbs will shrivel into a mummified, useless member (saving throw versus Staffs is allowed). The aging effect will automatically kill most creatures that have a short lifespan. Also note that effects of spent charges are cumulative, such that if 3 charges are used, the victim will not only receive damage, but he will be aged and have a withered limb.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of Wizardry [A]</strong>: This staff has all the powers of a staff of power. In addition, the staff may be used to cast the spells conjure elementals, invisibility, passwall, and web. The staff can also be used to create a whirlwind (identical to that created by a djinni) and can be used as a wand of paralyzation. Each of these abilities requires one charge. The staff may also be broken for a final blow. The results of a final blow depend on the number of charges in the staff. For each charge, 8 points of damage are dealt in a grand fireball to all monsters and characters (even the owner of the staff) within 30’. The staff is then broken and useless.</p>

<p><strong>Staff of the Serpent [D]</strong>: This staff does not employ charges. It strikes as a staff +1. The user can command the staff to grow to become a giant constrictor snake and constrict around a victim (AC 4, HD 3, hp 20, MV 20’). The command for the staff to become a snake is uttered as it strikes a victim. The victim must succeed in a saving throw versus Paralysis or be held immobile by the constricting snake for 1d4 turns, or until the owner commands the snake to release him. The serpent returns to the owner and returns to staff form after it has constricted around an opponent. If the snake form is slain, it will not return to staff form and the staff is destroyed. When the snake returns to staff form, all damage it has sustained in combat is automatically healed.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Cold</strong>: A chilling cone 60’ long and 30’ wide at the terminal end is discharged from this wand. Any beings within the cone of cold will suffer 6d6 points of damage unless they succeed in a saving throw versus Blast, which reduces damage to half. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Detecting Enemies</strong>: This wand makes any enemies of the wielder that are within 60’, whether invisible or hidden, become surrounded by a fiery red aura for up to 6 turns. An enemy is any creature with intent to harm the wielder. Only the wielder can see the aura. This effect requires one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Detecting Magic</strong>: This wand makes any magic item within 20’ become surrounded by a faint yellow aura for up to 2 turns. Only the wielder can see the aura. This effect requires one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Detecting Metals</strong>: After expending one charge, the wand will point in the direction of any concentration of metal that weighs 10 stone or more if it is within 60’, for up to 6 turns. The wand wielder is intuitively aware of the kind of metal detected, but a coating of lead will block the detection of other types of metals. This effect requires one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Detecting Secret Doors</strong>: This wand will make any and all secret doors within 30’ become surrounded by a blue glowing aura for up to 3 turns. Only the wielder can see the aura. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Detecting Traps</strong>: This wand makes any and all traps within 30’ become surrounded by a blue glowing aura for one round. Only the wielder can see the aura. This effect requires one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Negation</strong>: The wielder of this wand may choose a wand, rod, or staff wielded by an opponent, and render it powerless for 1 round. The item is powerless on the same round the wand of negation is used. Therefore, the action to use this wand must be announced prior to determining initiative. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Fear</strong>: This wand can discharge a cone 60’ long and 30’ wide at the terminal end. Any being within the cone will become fearful and flee for 30 rounds at running speed unless they succeed on a saving throw versus Wands. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Fire Balls</strong>: This wand can discharge a fireball, as the spell. It deals 6d6 points of damage unless the victim(s) succeed in a saving throw versus Blast, which reduces damage to half. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Illusion</strong>: The wielder of this wand can create the effects of the spell phantasmal force. Refer to this spell for the effects and concentration requirements. While concentrating on an illusory effect, the wielder can move at half movement, but if he is successfully struck in combat all concentration is lost and the illusion instantly fades away. Attempts to disbelieve the effects of this wand are resolved with a saving throw versus Wands.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Lightning Bolts</strong>: This wand can discharge a lightning bolt, as the spell. It deals 6d6 points of damage unless the victim(s) succeed in a saving throw versus Blasts, which reduces damage to half. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Magic Missiles</strong>: This wand fires one or two magic missiles (user’s choice) per round, as the arcane spell of the same name. The missiles inflict 1d6+1 points of damage each, and always strike. Each individual missile fired expends one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Paralyzation</strong>: This wand can discharge a cone 60’ long and 30’ wide at the terminal end. Any beings within the cone will become paralyzed for 6 turns unless they succeed in a saving throw versus Paralysis. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<p><strong>Wand of Polymorphing</strong>: This wand can produce the effects of the spells polymorph others or polymorph self, as determined by the wielder. The recipient is granted a saving throw versus Wands, and success negates the effect. A willing target can forgo a saving throw. One charge is expended per usage.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous-magic-items-1">Miscellaneous Magic Items</h3>

<p><strong>Amulet versus Crystal Balls and ESP</strong>: This amulet protects the wearer from being spied on by crystal balls or any type of ESP. The character attempting to spy upon the wearer will know he is being magically protected. The amulet’s magical protection against also prevents a crystal ball from spying on the items the character is wearing and his present location.</p>

<p><strong>Apparatus of the Crab</strong>: This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten levers. The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; Move 30’ forward, 60’ backward; AC 0; #AT 2 pinchers; Dmg 2d6. When attacking with the pinchers, the attack throws required are the same as the operator’s, and if a hit is scored, there is a chance that both pinchers strike, for a total of 4d6 points of damage (roll of 1-5 on 1d20).</p>

<p>Two characters of human size can fit inside. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.</p>

<p><strong>Bag of Devouring</strong>: This magical bag is the size of a small sack. It opens into a nondimensional space, seemingly identical to that of a bag of holding. After 6+1d4 turns, all items placed in this bag vanish and are permanently lost. The bag must be fully closed for this effect to take place.</p>

<p><strong>Bag of Holding</strong>: This appears to be a common small sack. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space. Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. It is large enough to fit an object that is 10’x5’x3’. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a maximum of 6 stone but holds up to 100 stone (1,000lb).</p>

<p><strong>Boat, Folding</strong>: A folding boat looks like a small wooden box-about 12” long, 6” wide, and 6” deep. It can be used to store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10’ long, 4’ wide, and 2’ in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24’ long, 8’ wide, and 6’ deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again. The necessary command words may be present, either visible or invisible, etched into the box. Alternatively, the command words may need to be sought through an NPC or a small quest.</p>

<p><strong>Boots of Levitation</strong>: On command, these leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if he had cast the spell levitate on himself. The duration is indefinite.</p>

<p><strong>Boots of Speed</strong>: These boots allow the wearer to move 240’ per turn for up to 12 hours. The wearer is exhausted after this activity, and is required to rest for a full day.</p>

<p><strong>Boots of Traveling and Springing</strong>: While these boots are worn, the wearer need not rest if engaged in ordinary movement. Further, he may spring up to 10’ high, and to a distance of 30’. A character equipped with this item gains a +10 bonus on Acrobatics throws.</p>

<p><strong>Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals</strong>: This bowl may be used to summon and control one water elemental per day, as the spell conjure elemental. The user must ready the magic item and conduct rituals that take 1 turn prior to the summoning. The summoning itself takes but 1 round. Once an elemental is summoned, the conjurer is required to continue concentration in order to give commands.</p>

<p><strong>Bracers of Armor</strong>: These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They grant the wearer an AC as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective, and no other armor may be worn with the bracers (magical or non-magical). Dexterity modifiers do apply. The protection offered by the bracers can be combined with other magical effects that alter AC, such as a ring of protection or cloak of protection. Roll on the table below to determine which kind of bracers are found.</p>

<p>Some of these (5%) will be cursed, actually lowering the wearer’s AC to 0, regardless of DEX modifiers or magical means of lowering AC. It will not be realized that the bracers are cursed until the wearer enters combat. These bracers may only be removed with the spell remove curse.</p>

<p><strong>Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals</strong>: This brazier may be used to summon and control one fire elemental per day as the spell conjure elemental. The user must ready the magic item and conduct rituals that take 1 turn prior to the summoning. The summoning itself takes but 1 round. Once an elemental is summoned, the conjurer is required to continue concentration in order to give commands.</p>

<p><strong>Brooch of Shielding</strong>: This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by spell or spell-like effect. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of damage from magic missiles before it melts and becomes useless.</p>

<p><strong>Broom of Flying</strong>: This magical broom of legend can fly with one riderat a movement rate of 240’ per, or with two riders at a movement rate of 180’ per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Censer of Controlling Air Elementals</strong>: This censer may be used to summon and control one air elemental per day as the spell conjure elemental. The user must ready the magic item and conduct rituals that take 1 turn prior to the summoning. The summoning itself takes but 1 round. Once an elemental is summoned, the conjurer is required to continue concentration in order to give commands.</p>

<p><strong>Chime of Opening</strong>: A chime of opening is a hollow orichalcum tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even a wizard lock cast by an arcane caster of lower than 9th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and wizard locked, it takes four uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the chime. Each use requires a charge, and when found a chime will contains 2d4x10 charges. When emptied of charges, the chime cracks and becomes useless.</p>

<p><strong>Cloak of Protection</strong>: This magical cloak appears to be an ordinary brown cloth or leather cloak. The cloak functions much like a ring of protection, offering a bonus to the wearer’s AC and all saving throws. These bonuses are cumulative if the cloak is worn with a ring of protection.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Ball</strong>: Any arcane spellcaster may use this coveted magic item to see images of distant creatures, objects, or places. The more familiar the user is with the creature, object or place viewed, the clearer the images will be. Each viewing can last for up to 1 turn, and the crystal ball may be used 3 times per day. The user of the crystal ball is unable to communicate to or cast spells at what he views.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Ball with Clairaudience</strong>: This kind of crystal ball has all of the properties of the ordinary one, but also grants the user the ability to hear noise and conversations through the ball.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Ball with ESP</strong>: This kind of crystal ball has all of the properties of the ordinary one, but also grants the user to ability to hear the thoughts of any one creature being observed, as per the spell ESP.</p>

<p><strong>Cube of Force</strong>: This device is about 3/4 inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up a special wall of force 10’ on a side around his person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every turn (or portion of a turn) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor’s speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.</p>

<p>Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be cast into or out of the cube:</p>

<p><strong>Cube of Frost Resistance</strong>: This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10’ on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65^0F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 turn (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a turn, the cube is destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Decanter of Endless Water</strong>: If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type, as well as the volume and velocity. The water continues pouring out until the command word is spoken to stop it.</p>

<p>“Stream” pours out 1 gallon per round.</p>

<p>“Fountain” produces a 5’ long stream at 5 gallons per round.</p>

<p>“Geyser” produces a 20’ long, 1’ wide stream at 30 gallons per round.</p>

<p>The geyser effect causes considerable backpressure, requiring the holder to be on stable ground and braced to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser kills small creatures of 1/2 HD or less and knocks down man-sized creatures unless they make a saving throw versus Paralysis. Creatures larger than man-sized are immune to the geyser.</p>

<p><strong>Displacer Cloak</strong>: This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves. All opponents suffer a -2 penalty on attack throws against the wearer of the cloak. In addition, the wearer receives a bonus of +2 on all saving throws.</p>

<p><strong>Drums of Panic</strong>: These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 240’ feet (with the exception of those within a 10’ radius safe zone around the drums) will become fearful and flee for 30 rounds at running speed. A saving throw versus Wands is allowed to resist the effect.</p>

<p><strong>Dust of Appearance</strong>: This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats all objects within a 10’ radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. The dust likewise negates the effects of mirror image, cloak of displacement, and elven cloaks. If the dust is blown through a tube it covers an area in the shape of a cone 20’ long and 15’ wide at its terminal end. The dust’s effect lasts for 2d10 turns. Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes, and 5d10 of these tubes or packets will be found at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Dust of Disappearance</strong>: This dust looks just like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible. Normal vision can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including detect invisible. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. The invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d10 turns, and the invisibility is not dispelled if the enchanted character makes attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Efreeti Bottle</strong>: This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly, and loyally serves the character for up to 101 days (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as the owner of the bottle commands. After the 101 days of service, the efreeti leaves to its home in the City of Brass, and the efreeti bottle becomes an ordinary, non-magical bottle.</p>

<p><strong>Elven Cloak</strong>: This light, iridescent cloak is made by the magical and nimble hands of the elves. It allows the wearer to blend into his surroundings to the point of becoming nearly invisible. The cloak adds a +8 bonus to any proficiency throws to hide in shadows. Characters wearing elven cloaks can always hide in shadows with a throw of at least 12+.</p>

<p><strong>Elven Boots</strong>: These fine leather boots are made with the magical craftsmanship of the elves. Commonly used by elven nightblades, they add a +8 bonus to any proficiency throws to move silently. Characters wearing elven boots can always move silently with a throw of at least 12+.</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of Charming</strong>: These two crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes. The wearer is able to use charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target’s gaze. Those failing a saving throw versus Spells are charmed as per the spell. If the wearer has both lenses, there is a penalty of -2 to the saving throw. If the wearer has only one lens, the saving throw is made with a bonus of +2.</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of the Eagle</strong>: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses allow the wearer to see 100 times further than normal. The wearer’s improved vision reduces his penalty for missile attacks at medium range to -1 and at long range to -2. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Thereafter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so long as he covers his other eye.</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of Petrification</strong>: These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. When a being places the eyes on, he is instantly petrified, as if subjected to a flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw. About 1/4 (01-25 on d100) of these eyes allow the wearer to use a petrification gaze attack. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective, and the victim is allowed a saving throw versus Petrification to resist the effect.</p>

<p>Note that no magical eyes may be combined for multiple effects.</p>

<p><strong>Flying Carpet</strong>: A flying carpet is enchanted to fly by command, with passengers. If 1 passenger is carried, the carpet may move up to 300’ per turn. If two or three passengers are carried, this is reduced to 240’ or 180’ per turn, respectively. No more than three human-sized passengers, or a total of 60 stone, may be carried.</p>

<p><strong>Gauntlets of Ogre Power</strong>: These gauntlets are made of tough leather, with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer the great strength of 18, granting all of the benefits to attack throws and damage rolls that this strength score confers. The wearer may punch with these gloves, inflicting 1d4 points of damage. These gauntlets further allow the wearer to transport an extra 10 stone. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.</p>

<p><strong>Girdle of Giant Strength</strong>: A girdle of giant strength confers the great strength of a hill giant to the wearer. The wearer attacks as an 8 HD monster or as his own class and level, whichever is better, and the character inflicts double normal damage with his attacks. The character also can throw rocks at opponents to a distance of 200’ for 3d6 points of damage and gains a +16 bonus to force open doors. The benefits of the girdle stack with the character’s bonus or penalty from his Strength. A weak character who wears the girdle has the strength of a weak giant, while a very strong character gains the strength of a very strong giant!</p>

<p><strong>Helm of Alignment Changing</strong>: This ornate helmet instantly changes the alignment of the being that places it on. The change is random. The helmet cannot be removed except by the spell remove curse. The wearer will not desire for the helmet to be removed, but once it has been taken off, he reverts back to his original alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Helm of Comprehending Languages</strong>: Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehending languages grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature, and to read text in any language or any magical writing. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use unless the magic is usable by the character’s class and level.</p>

<p><strong>Helm of Telepathy</strong>: The wearer can read the thoughts of any creature within 90’ at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Use of this helm requires full concentration of the wearer, who may not move or take any action.</p>

<p><strong>Helm of Teleportation</strong>: This item will not function until a teleport spell is cast upon it. Afterwards, it may be used to teleport as often as desired, up to a maximum of once per turn. The user may try to teleport another creature by touching it; an unwilling creature may resist the effect with a saving throw versus Staffs. Once the helm is used to transport an unwilling creature, it will cease to function until recharged with another teleport spell.</p>

<p><strong>Horn of Blasting</strong>: This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. When the instrument is played, once per turn it deals 2d6 points of damage to creatures within a cone 100’ long and 20’ wide at its termination point. The horn causes creatures to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a saving throw versus Blast negates the deafening). Other objects may take damage in other ways, at the Judge’s discretion. For example, a small hut might be completely leveled with a blast from the horn, but a portion of stone wall 10’ wide might take three or four horn blasts. The horn may be blown once per turn.</p>

<p><strong>Medallion of ESP</strong>: This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. The medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as per the arcane spell ESP. The wearer can read the thoughts of any creature within 30’ after concentrating for one round. The wearer may move at half speed, but is unable to cast spells or attack while concentrating. There is a 1 in 6 chance (roll 1 on 1d6) that, unknown to the user of the medallion, his thoughts are heard by all beings within 30’ instead of the usual effect. The creature whose mind is read may make a saving throw versus Staffs to negate the effect if it suspects it is being spied on.</p>

<p><strong>Medallion of ESP (90’)</strong>: This medallion functions as a medallion of ESP, but has a range to 90’ rather than 30’.</p>

<p><strong>Mirror of Life Trapping</strong>: This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. A mirror of life trapping has twenty nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any human-sized or smaller creature that looks into the device must make a saving throw versus Staffs or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. When all cells are full, the mirror does not trap any more beings. When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror along with all its clothing and equipment. Creatures trapped within the mirror do not age, breathe, or eat, and are completely powerless. Anyone may call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage the powerless prisoner in conversation. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.</p>

<p><strong>Mirror of Opposition</strong>: This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. If a creature is reflected in the mirror’s surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately and relentlessly attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely.</p>

<p><strong>Necklace of Adaptation</strong>: This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases. The bubble can enable the wearer to survive in an environment without air for 1 week.</p>

<p><strong>Rope of Climbing</strong>: A 50-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 100 stone (1,000lb). Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10’ per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.</p>

<p><strong>Scarab of Protection</strong>: This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. The scarab’s possessor gains immunity to any curse and finger of death spells or effects, regardless of the source. Upon absorbing 2d6 such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals</strong>: This small stone may be used to summon and control one earth elemental per day as the spell conjure elemental. The user must ready the magic item and conduct rituals that take 1 turn prior to the summoning. The summoning itself takes but 1 round. Once an elemental is summoned, the conjurer is required to continue concentration in order to give commands.</p>

<h3 id="weapons-armor-and-swords">Weapons, Armor, and Swords</h3>

<p>Magical weapons and armor follow the same class restrictions as all normal weapons and armor. Magic items will have a “+” value, or if cursed they will have a “-“ negative value. When an item has a plus, such as a dagger +1, this means that rolls to hit and damage rolls receive a +1 bonus. Armor with a plus will improve the AC by the amount specified. For example, leather armor +1 would improve AC to 3 rather than 2.</p>

<p>Cursed items have the opposite effect, incurring penalties based on the negative value provided. Cursed items, once possessed by a character, can only be disposed of with a dispel evil or remove curse spell. The owner of a cursed item will not believe the item is cursed, and will resist efforts to get rid of the item until one of these spells is cast. Furthermore, the possessor of a cursed weapon will prefer to use this weapon in combat above any other weapon.</p>

<p>Magical armor of the non-cursed variety is lighter and less cumbersome than other armor. Refer to the table below for magical armor weights and for rolling up the kind of armor found by a party. For each additional +1 after the first, reduce the weight by an additional stone, to a minimum of 0.</p>

<h3 id="swords-1">Swords</h3>

<p>Other powers beyond having a “+” to their attacks and damage sometimes apply to swords and other weapons. They also may have more than one bonus listed, where the first bonus applies to all attacks and damage, and the second applies only to an exclusive group of creatures. Some of these are detailed below, and others listed in the treasure tables are self-explanatory. Other weapons have powers that the wielder is able to command. These weapons are detailed below.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +1, flame tongue</strong>: This sword is +2 against regenerating or avian monsters and +3 against undead or plant-like monsters. When the wielder utters a command, the sword becomes engulfed in flame. The flames provide the same amount of light as a torch, and can be used to ignite anything flammable.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +1, life drinker</strong>: This sword drains a Hit Die or a life level from any target struck if the wielder utters a command. This sword has 1d4+4 charges, and each use of this ability drains one charge. Once the charges have been used, the sword performs as a normal sword +1.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +1, locate objects</strong>: The wielder may locate objects as the arcane spell one time each day, to a range of 120’.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +1, luck blade</strong>: This sword grants its possessor a +1 bonus on all saving throws. In addition, a luck blade will contain 1d4+1 wishes. When the last wish is used, the sword remains a sword +1 and still grants the +1 saving throw bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +2, charm person</strong>: In addition to functioning as a sword +1, this sword grants the wielder the ability to charm person, as the arcane spell, 3 times in a week.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +3, frost brand</strong>: The frost brand is a sword +6 against monsters that live in a hot environment or use a fire-based attack. The sword sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0^0F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire in the same manner as wearing a ring of fire resistance. A frost brand extinguishes all non-magical fires in a 10’ area when touched to a flame.</p>

<p><strong>Sword +3, vorpal</strong>: The legendary vorpal sword is the sharpest weapon known to man. On a natural attack throw of 20, the wielder of a vorpal blade will decapitate any creature struck, unless it succeeds in a saving throw versus Death. Even if the target makes its saving throw, the vorpal blade will inflict double normal damage to it. (Creatures without a head, such as oozes, cannot be decapitated, but still take double damage on a natural attack throw of 20.)</p>

<h3 id="other-magic-weapons">Other Magic Weapons</h3>

<p><strong>War Hammer +2, Dwarven Thrower</strong>: In the hands of a creature other than a dwarf, this is an ordinary war hammer +2. Wielded by a dwarf, the war hammer gains an additional +1 bonus (for a total bonus of +3) and can be hurled with a 60’ range. When hurled, it deals triple damage against giant humanoids, and double damage against any other target. It unerringly returns to the dwarf’s hand after being thrown.</p>

<p><strong>Arrow +3, Slaying Arrow</strong>: This arrow +3 is keyed to a particular type of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target instantly dies, with no saving throw. Against any other target the arrow functions as an arrow +3. These arrows are often adorned with decorations that imply the creature they can slay. To determine the type of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below. The Judge may add to this list, or choose an appropriate creature type for the situation.</p>

<h3 id="sentient-weapons">Sentient Weapons</h3>

<p>Particularly powerful magical weapons are sometimes thinking and intelligent entities, known as sentient weapons. These weapons have motivations of their own, and may or may not be hostile to their wielder. The Judge plays the personalities of these items in the same manner as an NPC.</p>

<p>A sword has a percentage chance to be sentient equal to its highest magical bonus x2. Other magic weapons have a percentage chance equal to their highest magical bonus. If the weapon is a life drinker, luck blade, vorpal blade, or dwarven thrower, the chance of intelligence is doubled.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: The highest bonus of a sword +1, +2 versus spellcasters is 2, giving it a (2 x2%) 4% chance to be sentient. The highest bonus of a dwarven thrower is 3, giving it a (3 x 1% x 2) 6% chance to be sentient. The highest bonus of a vorpal sword +3 is 3, giving it a (3 x 2% x 2) 12% chance to be sentient.</p>

<p>If a weapon is sentient, determine its Intelligence, Alignment, Ego, Willpower, and Powers using the rules below.</p>

<h4 id="intelligence-and-languages">Intelligence and Languages</h4>

<p>The first step to creating a sentient weapon is to roll for its Intelligence. The Intelligence ability score will determine how many additional powers the sword possesses. Consult the table below.</p>

<p>When a sword communicates through empathy, no actual words are exchanged between it and its wielder, but the wielder becomes intuitively aware of the powers the sword possesses and how these can be employed. A sword capable of speech actually produces an audible voice and speaks to those around it. Sentient weapons capable of read languages do so as the arcane spell, but the ability is always active.</p>

<p>In addition to knowing the language of its maker, sentient weapons will understand an additional number of languages to be determined below.</p>

<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>

<p>Every sentient weapon will have an alignment. This alignment is undetectable until the sword is touched. A character may only wield a sword that shares the same alignment, and if he attempts to handle a sword of a different alignment he will suffer damage each round. The severity of the damage is related to the degree of difference of alignment. For each degree of difference, the character will suffer 1d6 points of damage. For example, a chaotic sword will inflict 1d6 hp damage to a neutral character; it will inflict 2d6 hp damage to a lawful character. For this reason, a neutral sword will only ever inflict 1d6 points of damage. Roll on the chart below to determine a sentient weapon’s alignment.</p>

<h4 id="ego-and-willpower">Ego and Willpower</h4>

<p>Sentient weapons have an Ego rating from 1-12 (roll 1d12). This rating represents the overall strength of character that the sword has. In addition, sentient weapons have a base willpower rating equal to the sum of its INT and EGO. A bonus of +1 is added to this rating for each spell-like power the sword possesses. Spell-like powers are discussed below.</p>

<p>A sentient weapon may mentally wrestle for dominance with its wielder, depending on the sword’s personality and desires. Under certain situations, the Judge will need to make an influence check. This may be made in the following situations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The wielder first touches the sword</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sword’s motivation comes into play</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A character of a differing alignment touches the sword</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another magical sword is found</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A character has lost 50% of his hp</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When an influence check is called for, the willpower of the sword and the willpower of the character are compared, and the highest score wins the test. A character’s willpower is determined by summing his WIS and STR. The character can add an additional +1 to his Willpower for each level of experience beyond 8. The character subtracts 1d4 from this total if he is wounded but has more than or equal to 50% of his hp. If he has less than 50% of his hp, 2d4 is subtracted from willpower. The sword receives a bonus of 1d10 to its willpower if its alignment is not the same as the character’s.</p>

<p>If the character loses, then he loses control of his actions for an amount of time determined by the Judge. The sword will force the character to perform a task, such as disposing of or ignoring magic items if a second magical sword is found. Other actions include compelling the wielder into combat or surrender with a nearby foe, or making the character perform another action that serves the desires and goals of the sword. Usually, the duration of control will only be for several rounds until the task is completed.</p>

<h4 id="sentient-weapon-motivations">Sentient Weapon Motivations</h4>

<p>Sentient weapons have a 5% probability of having a particular motivation (roll 01-05 on d00). These motivations involve the destruction of particular races, monster types, or alignments. If a sword has a motivation, raise its INT and EGO each to 12.</p>

<p>Roll on the table below to determine a sentient weapon’s motivation. Alternatively, the Judge may choose an opponent type based on differing characteristics (all reptiles, beings of a certain religion, etc.).</p>

<p>When a sentient weapon is used to attack an opponent that fits its motivation, a special power is used against the opponent. These powers are determined by the alignment of the sword. A chaotic sword will energy drain an opponent of the appropriate type by one level per point of magical bonus. A lawful sword will strike an opponent of the appropriate type for one extra damage die per point of magical bonus. A neutral sword will grants the sword wielder a bonus to Armor Class and saving throws equals to its magical bonus when combating an appropriate opponent.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: Blackguard is a chaotic +3 vorpal two-handed sword with a motivation to destroy lawful opponents. It energy drains 3 levels from any lawful opponent it strikes.</p>

<h4 id="powers">Powers</h4>

<p>Sentient weapons can have two kinds of additional powers: detection powers and spell-like powers. The sword wielder must be holding the sword to activate and maintain any of its powers, and no more than one power can be active at once.</p>

<p>Detection powers allow the sword to detect any of a number of possible items or inclinations. All detection powers are identical to either wands or spells of the same type, and all the same rules apply. Each of a sword’s detection powers may be used up to 3 times per day. Spell-like powers mimic spells or have effects similar to those of spells. All spell-like powers may only be used 3 times total in one day. To determine powers, roll on the <a href="Chapter09.html#detection-powers">Detection Powers</a> table and ignore identical results if required to roll more than once. The same holds true if required to roll on the <a href="Chapter09.html#spell-like-powers">Spell-like Powers</a> table.</p>

<p>In any campaign, adventurers will seek to buy and sell magic items. ACKS assumes that the market for magic items is illiquid and inefficient. Most magic items found by adventurers were created long ago, and are of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history, which drives their price down. The majority of magic items created during the campaign are assumed to be for mage’s personal use and research, or commissioned pieces created for exceptionally wealthy patrons. The <a href="Chapter09.html#magic-item-transactions-by-market-class">Magic Item Transactions by Market Class</a> table governs buying and selling magic items.</p>

<h4 id="selling-magic-items">Selling Magic Items</h4>

<p>Adventurers can sell magic items they have made for twice the base cost to make the item. (Magic items made from a formula or sample can thus command a great margin!) Adventurers can sell identified magic items found, discovered, looted, or otherwise acquired for the base cost to make the item. The difference in selling price reflects the difference in value between an item of known make and authenticity and an item of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history.</p>

<p>In order to sell one or more magic items, the adventurer must be in a market of sufficient size. The number of potential buyers for magic items in a month will be determined by the price of the items and the market class within which they are sold.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: Using a formula, Quintus and his assistants made 4 scrolls of fireball (base cost 1,500gp) at a cost of 750gp each. Quintus has a henchman take these to sell them in a Class III market. There is a 25% chance of a buyer for one scroll each month, at a price of 3,000gp each. Quintus also asks his henchman to sell a sword +2 (base cost 15,000gp) he found in an evil crypt. The sword +2 will sell for 15,000gp. There is a 25% chance of a buyer for the sword each month. After four months, Quintus’ henchman returns with 2,700gp - 12,000gp for the scrolls and 15,000gp for the sword.</p>

<h4 id="buying-magic-items">Buying Magic Items</h4>

<p>Adventurers can buy magic items for twice the base cost to make the item. In order to buy magic items, the adventurer must be in a market of sufficient size. The number of potential sellers of magic items in a month will be determined by the price of the items and the market class within which they are sold. Magic items are generally available only in small quantities, even in large markets.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: Marcus is about to set out on an adventure from his home base. He decides to buy potions of healing (base cost 500gp). Stopping by the local Temple of the Sun god, he finds one potion for sale for 1,000gp. Later, Marcus travels to the awe-inspiring capital of the empire (Class I market). There he can buy 7 potions of healing for 1,000gp each, and even 2 potions of extra-healing (base cost 2,000gp) for 4,000gp each.</p>

<h4 id="commissioning-magic-items">Commissioning Magic Items</h4>

<p>On occasion, adventurers may commission powerful spellcasters to create magic items on their behalf. Spellcasters powerful enough to create magic items for hire can only be found in Class I markets, or through adventures.</p>

<p>The advantage to commissioning a magic item is that the item can be made exactly to the adventurer’s specification. The disadvantages are cost and time. The base cost and time required to create a magic item is listed on the <a href="Chapter07.html#magic-item-creation">Magic Item Creation</a> table in Chapter 7 under <a href="Chapter07.html#magic-research">Magic Research</a>. The adventurer commissioning the item will be responsible up front for paying the base cost and the cost of any precious materials, and for providing any required special components. If the spellcaster successfully completes the item, the adventurer will then be charged an additional fee equal to 7,000gp per month, or twice the base cost, whichever is greater.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: Marcus hires a mage to create a suit of plate armor +3 (base cost 35,000gp, base time 8 months). After describing the elaborate appearance he demands, Marcus pays 35,000gp. He also pays for 30,000gp worth of precious materials to be used in the items construction, to help ensure its successful creation (and to make it look spectacular). Finally, he delivers the special component, the iron hides of 25 gorgons, to the mage. When the mage completes the armor 8 months later, Marcus pays him an additional 70,000gp (twice the base cost). Marcus has spent 135,000gp on his armor, enough to build a keep.</p>
