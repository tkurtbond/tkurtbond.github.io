of Of Good Game Mastering: Player Types</h1>
<p>People play roleplaying games for all sorts of reasons, but a few
basic types tend to recur in large numbers. (I didn’t invent these
categories, many of which originate with the late Glen Blacow. I have
departed a bit from the traditional list, though.)</p>
<p><strong>The Power Gamer</strong> wants to make his character bigger,
tougher, buffer, and richer. However success is defined by the rules
system you’re using, this player wants more of it. He tends to see his
PC as an abstraction, as a collection of super powers optimized for the
acquisition of still more super powers. He pays close attention to the
rules, with a special eye to finding quirks and breakpoints he can
exploit to get large benefits at comparatively low costs. He wants you
to put the “game” back in the term “roleplaying game,” and to give him
good opportunities to add shiny new abilities to his character
sheet.</p>
<p><strong>The Butt-Kicker</strong> wants to let off steam with a little
old-fashioned vicarious mayhem. He picks a simple, combat-ready
character, whether or not that is the best route to power and success in
the system. After a long day in the office or classroom, he wants his
character to clobber foes and once more prove his superiority over all
who would challenge him. He may care enough about the rules to make his
PC an optimal engine of destruction, or may be indifferent to them, so
long as he gets to hit things. He expects you to provide his character
plenty of chances to engage in the aforementioned clobbering and
superiority.</p>
<p><strong>The Tactician</strong> is probably a military buff, who wants
chances to think his way through complex, realistic problems, usually
those of the battlefield. He wants the rules, and your interpretations
of them, to jibe with reality as he knows it, or at least to portray an
internally consistent, logical world in which the quality of his choices
is the biggest determining factor in his success or failure. He may view
issues of characterization as a distraction. He becomes annoyed when
other players do things which fit their PCs’ personalities, but are
tactically unsound. To satisfy him, you must provide challenging yet
logical obstacles for his character to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>The Specialist</strong> favors a particular character type,
which he plays in every campaign and in every setting. The most common
sub-type of specialist is the player who wants to be a ninja every time.
Other specialists might favor knights, cat-people, mischief-makers,
flying characters, or wistful druid maidens who spend a lot of time
hanging about sylvan glades with faeries and unicorns. The specialist
wants the rules to support his favored character type, but is otherwise
indifferent to them. To make a specialist happy, you have to create
scenes in which his character can do the cool things for which the
archetype is known.</p>
<p><strong>The Method Actor</strong> believes that roleplaying is a
medium for personal expression, strongly identifying with the characters
he plays. He may believe that it’s creatively important to establish a
radically different character each time out. The method actor bases his
decisions on his understanding of his character’s psychology, and may
become obstructive if other group members expect him to contradict it
for rules reasons, or in pursuit of a broader goal. He may view rules
as, at best, a necessary evil, preferring sessions in which the dice
never come out of their bags. Situations that test or deepen his
personality traits are your key to entertaining the method actor.</p>
<p><strong>The Storyteller</strong>, like the method actor, is more
inclined to the roleplaying side of the equation and less interested in
numbers and experience points. On the other hand, he’s more interested
in taking part in a fun narrative that feels like a book or a movie than
in strict identification with his character. He’s quick to com- promise
if it moves the story forward, and may get bored when the game slows
down for a long planning session. You can please him by introducing and
developing plot threads, and by keeping the action moving, as would any
skilled novelist or film director.</p>
<p><strong>The Casual Gamer</strong> is often forgotten in discussions
of this sort, but almost every group uncomfortable taking center stage
even in a small group. Often, they’re present to hang out with the
group, and game just because it happens to be the activity everyone else
has chosen. Though they’re elusive creatures, casual gamers can be
vitally important to a gaming group’s survival. They fill out the ranks,
which is especially important in games that spread vital PC abilities
across a wide number of character types or classes. Especially if
they’re present mostly for social reasons, they may fill an important
role in the group’s interpersonal dynamic. Often they’re the mellow,
moderating types who keep the more assertive personalities from each
other’s throats – in or out of character. I mention the casual player
because the thing he most fervently wants is to remain in the
background. He doesn’t want to have to learn rules or come up with a
plot hook for his character or engage in detailed planning. You may
think it’s a bad thing that he sits there for much of the session
thumbing through your latest purchases from the comic book store, but
hey, that’s what he wants. The last thing you want to do is to force him
into a greater degree of participation than he’s comfortable with. (Of
course, if everybody in the group is sitting there reading your comic
books, you’ve definitely got a problem . . .)</p>
