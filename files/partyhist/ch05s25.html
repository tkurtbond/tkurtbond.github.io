<p>
	The festival at Finn's Waste<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263088904"></a> turned out to be impressive,
	bringing thousands of worshipers from all over Carzala, and
	much of the preaching called on the worshipers to be ready to
	bring unbelievers to Arkan's Throne<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263089624"></a> to be judged, on the coming Day
	of the Rule of Arkan.  The festival took place around a huge
	monolith, carved at the top in the shape of a godly head.  The
	party observed that there were caves hidden inside the
	monolith, and snuck inside under cover of invisibility.
      </p>
<p> 
	Inside the monolith they found the true center of Arkanian
	worship and discovered it revolved around human
	sacrifice<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263090952"></a> and demonic
	worship.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263091528"></a> In the main temple were two huge
	and unsettling paintings, one of which the characters
	recognized as the view from the Entrance to
	Makad-al-Arakan,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263092232"></a>
	the World of the Arakanisi and the other of which they
	recognized as the Hall of the Great
	Spider<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263092872"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263093288"></a> from the caves behind the
	Smugglers' Cove.  While sneaking about the party overheard a
	discussion linking the Arkanians to the conspiracy of Amur
	Gibbetsmaster and the death of Balour
	Shaw.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263094024"></a>
	They went on to disrupt a ritual intended to call up Arakan,
	during which they killed a few devils, and rescued some prisoners
	intended for sacrifice.  One of the prisoners turned out to be
	Gerrod,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263094760"></a> the
	marine who vanished from the Spider Hall.  On their way out
	the party collapsed the access tunnel to the complex under the
	monolith.  Returning to Seagate, they reported to the
	Count,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263095496"></a> who sent out troops to capture the
	Arkanians left at Finn's Waste and slapped stiff restrictions
	on the other Arkanians in the County.
      </p>
<p>
	Knowing the party will have other things to do,
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263096648"></a> and
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263097192"></a>
	agreed to subcontract the exploration of an alternate route to
	the Vale of Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263097816"></a> to a group of adventures calling
	themselves BAMF,
	Inc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263098408"></a> The count
	retired Gerrod<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263098968"></a>
	into the party's service at his request, where he quickly
	became an indispensable `butler'.
