<p>
	(This scenario was Gamesmastered by
	N. Alan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263102488"></a>
	Bond.)  During the night of the first day of this scenario,
	the characters were awakened by a loud rapping on their
	bedroom doors and the snooty voice of Elbain the
	Small<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263103192"></a> telling our heroes to gather in
	their common room.  There the adventures met Amlach the
	Golden<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263103848"></a> who represented the
	Yester.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263104424"></a> After
	Amlach offered a job and a reasonable price for the party's
	services, the adventurers agreed to undertake the offered
	mission.  The next morning, our heroes set out on a ship
	provided by the Yester which traveled from Seagate to
	Swithan's Cove.  After departing from the boat with the Yester
	Rabon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263105272"></a> as their
	guide, the party traveled across the Plain of Desai to a point
	in the Southern Palisades.
      </p>
<p>
	From here the party traveled into the heart of the mountains.
	Rabon guided the party along a trail that was badly
	deteriorated, but had recently seen some use.  On the second
	day of travel in the mountains, the party spotted a sentinel
	fleeing along the trail.  The sentinel escaped from the
	party's partial attempt at pursuit.  With the Arkons so
	warned, the party was ambushed <span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span>.
	(The second ambush occurred after the party allowed a prisoner
	to scream during a tortu... ah interrogation session.  The
	party was saved during the ambushes by
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263107272"></a>
	Torson's brilliant fighting technique, of course.)  After
	dealing with the ambushes the party found the Cathedral.
      </p>
<p>
	When darkness fell, Jamie and
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263108360"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263108760"></a> eliminated the sentinels on the
	keep's walls which allowed the party to enter the keep and
	ascend to the stairs to the cathedral, with
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263109432"></a> Torson
	covering the advance of the party with his powerful magics.
	Our heroes were thus able to gain entrance to the cathedral
	and close the portculius with a few encounters with the enemy.
	After a short rest, Rabon took a small magical
	<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">boomb</span>”</span><a href="#ftn.idp140214263110488" class="footnote" name="idp140214263110488"><sup class="footnote">[25]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263111192"></a>
	from his pack and planted it next to the entrance of the
	tunnel.  The party then followed the corkscrew tunnel into the
	darkness, pausing only to deposit more of Rabon's <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">boombs</span>”</span>.
	At the bottom of the tunnel, the party met the eternal
	champion and Rabon reclaimed the sword the champion carried.
	Through here the party traveled through a downshaft to the
	private chambers of the Elite.  Here the party planted more
	bombs, found treasure, and harassed a disembodied voice with
	slight telekinetic powers.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263112632"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	During their search through the Elite's chambers, the party
	discovered a secret exit which they followed to a cave that
	led to the sea.  Rabon activated his bombs and the party then
	sailed in a small boat back to Swithan's Cove and rejoined the
	ship of the Yester which took them back to Seagate.
