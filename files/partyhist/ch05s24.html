<p>
	The party returned to Seagate from Smugglers'
	Cove<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263072504"></a>
	with two ships loaded with treasure.  Once there they
	investigated selling the non-drug portion of the cargo in
	Carzala (the Count<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263073176"></a> had forbidden them to sell the
	drugs in Carzala).  After talking with several merchants,
	including Vlad Sharp-knife,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263073848"></a> they decided to keep the
	ships and to start their own merchant company.  They hired
	crews and officers and so forth and started the company, with
	Winther and Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263074568"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263074968"></a>
	taking the lead in keeping track of all the details, and Vlad
	Sharp-knife providing occasional consulting.  After
	Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263075624"></a>
	recovered she began taking a great deal of interest in the
	business.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263076232"></a> They sold the non-lethal
	drugs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263077096"></a> in the
	North, against the wishes and vehement protests of
	Winther,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263077704"></a> but
	to the great enrichment of the party.
      </p>
<p>
	Gim made a trip to Arn's Ferry,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263078728"></a> where he discovered that
	Ilene,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263079304"></a> young
	woman whom the party rescued from the Force Dome in Sassym's
	Stronghold,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263079928"></a> was rebuilding Balour Shaw's
	tower with the help of some
	Dwarves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263080552"></a> She
	had been away at the time of the explosion and believed Balour
	Shaw dead when she heard of it.  Back in Seagate,
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263081208"></a>
	visited the Count's archives, and discovered that the tower
	was standing when Carzala was settled by humans, and inhabited
	then as well.
      </p>
<p>
	The party went to Dhairrhuwyth,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263082328"></a>
	a local mage, to get some
	magic items identified.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263082920" class="footnote" name="idp140214263082920"><sup class="footnote">[24]</sup></a>
      The mage turned out to have known Balour Shaw, and had been
      investigating the explosion of Balour Shaw's tower.  He had
      found out that a single gold coin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263083912"></a> with a eight-pointed star was
      found on top the rubble, that Balour Shaw had killed three
      assassins carrying similar coins several years ago when the
      assassins were after a party of adventurers, and that one of
      the major symbols of the
      Arkanian<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263084744"></a>
      cult is an eight-pointed
      star.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263085320"></a> He asked the party to accompany him
      to the upcoming Arkanian Festival at Finn's Waste during the
      solstice, where he hoped to find out more about the Arkanians.
