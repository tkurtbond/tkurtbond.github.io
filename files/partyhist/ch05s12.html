<p>
	The nomads moved to Tuath's Rest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262877528"></a> after the water subsided, partially
	to prevent another hive of Thri-Kreen from moving in.  The
	party finally left for the south, taking with them a chest of
	treasure<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262878232"></a> that the nomads had found in the
	ravine, which they agreed to trade for various things the
	tribe wanted in return for a share of the profits.  Their
	guide was
	Dahlil,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262878952"></a> who
	had visited the Kingdoms of the Five Sisters before.  They
	took a road he was not very familiar with because the more
	familiar road led to two kingdoms currently at war where the
	party would not have been welcome.  Along the way they
	encountered sand-storms and various unfriendly denizens of the
	desert.
      </p>
<p>
	One of the oasis they found was surrounded by nomad
	tents,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262880264"></a> but the inhabitants (the
	Lakal<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262880856"></a> tribe)
	and all their animals had been beaten to death by blunt
	instruments, and the well had been fouled with their bodies.
	Desperately in need of water, the party headed south to the
	nearest oasis.  Along the way they were constantly harassed by
	creatures made of sand.  They finally reached the oasis, which
	was located in a small range of mountains; while they were at
	the oasis they were attacked by a
	Roc,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262881816"></a> and some of
	their pack and riding
	lizards<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262882376"></a> were
	killed.
      </p>
<p>
	Fleeing south, they found that their way out of the mountains
	and onto the desert was blocked by a huge
	sandwhip,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262883448"></a> a creature that lives under the
	sand and entangles any animals that walk over it in its many
	tentacles.  This one was huge, over three hundred feet in
	diameter.  Unable to return the way they come because of the
	Roc and other monsters, they first tried to poison the
	sandwhip.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262884264" class="footnote" name="idp140214262884264"><sup class="footnote">[17]</sup></a>
      When that was unsuccessful, Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262886088"></a> Torson summoned the Roc, although
      he was unable to control it; the sandwhip attacked the Roc,
      and in the ensuing battle the party slipped by.
      </p>
<p>
	Crossing a huge salt flats, the Salt
	Sea,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262887240"></a> they
	came to an inhabited oasis,
	Sev-a-kalam,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262887832"></a>
	where they stopped briefly to rest and recuperate.
