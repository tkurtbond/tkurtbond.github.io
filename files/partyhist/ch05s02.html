<p>
	The wealthy merchant
	Rasson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262708488"></a> hired
	the party to rescue his son,
	Turon.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262709064"></a> Three
	months before, Turon had been abducted by an enemy of
	Rasson's, a mage.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262709688"></a> The mage drove Turon mad and turned
	him loose in the Wilderlands of
	Gilarni,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262710296"></a> a forest territory claimed by
	Elves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262710888"></a> When
	Rasson found out he sent his men to bring his son back, but
	they were ambushed and massacred by the Elves, for Turon in
	his madness had attacked and killed an Elf, and the Elves in
	turn were killing any humans in the forest in retaliation.
	After this Rasson hired the party because one of them was an
	Elf.
      </p>
<p>
	On the way to the Wilderlands of Gilarni the party stayed at
	the inn at Arn's Ferry,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262712232"></a> where they were attacked by an
	assassin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262712808"></a> who (as they found out afterwards)
	carried a strange coin: it was a large gold coin, not one that
	any of the party had ever see, and was obviously carved rather
	than minted.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262713544"></a>
	
	They survived the attack, but were thrown out of the inn and
	could only find lodging in a strange tower inhabited by an
	even stranger old man,
	Balour Shaw,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262714600"></a>
	who habitually spoke in a 
	<span class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span>
	enigmatic
	manner.  The next morning they found three more assassins
	frozen to death outside the tower; each carried one of the
	strange gold coins.
      </p>
<p>
	Once in the Wilderlands of Gilarni, the party was accosted by
	Elves, but Gim Torson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262716168"></a> convinced the Elves that allowing
	the party to complete their mission was something to be
	desired by all involved (expect The
	Mage,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262716840"></a> of
	course) and that Turon was not responsible for his actions.
	The party rescued Turon from the riverside
	cave<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262717496"></a>
	where he was living (battering him somewhat in the process),
	disposed of some of the mage's henchmen who attacked them, and
	returned Turon to his father Rasson.  Gim Torson later
	revisited Balour Shaw and began learning magic from
	him.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262718280"></a>
