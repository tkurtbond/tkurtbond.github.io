<p>
	Upon reaching Seagate they immediately warned the Count of
	Amur Gibbetsmaster's perfidy.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263040760"></a> The count asked them to
	discretely abduct Amur Gibbetsmaster from the Baron of
	Seagate's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263041400"></a> country castle.  He hoped to
	prevent the civil war that would undoubtedly result if the
	Count were to ask for Gibbetsmaster's head and the Baron were
	to refuse.
      </p>
<p>
	The characters' succeeded, much to everybody's surprise, and
	brought Gibbetsmaster to justice in Seagate, where he was 
	interrogated by the Count's chief Mage.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263042680"></a>
	It was revealed that he was part of a conspiracy<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263043288"></a>
	to weaken
	the count and had been for several years.  Unfortunately, he
	did not reveal the names of any of the other leaders,
	although he did reveal that the conspiracy was led by a
	powerful mage, and listed many of the landing places of the
	smugglers and pirates<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263044088"></a>
	and his contacts with them.  Amur
	Gibbetsmaster died after making a signed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263044696"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263045768"></a>
      confession.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263047000" class="footnote" name="idp140214263047000"><sup class="footnote">[22]</sup></a>

	The characters were greatly rewarded for their services.
	First they were given the captured ships and cargo.  Next
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263048232"></a>
	and Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263048776"></a>
	were pardoned<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263049320"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263049992"></a> for any crimes they might have
	committed in the past.  Finally the party was
	given<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263050888"></a>
	Korsepolis, the Vale of Morin, and the Mountain Wall to hold,
	clean of danger, and rebuild for trade with the south, as a
	new barony.  This
	latter proved especially unpopular with some of the court, who
	were sure they were more deserving and better fitted for this
	honor and responsibility: after all, who were the adventurers
	but a bunch of jumped up thugs?
	Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263052328"></a>
	started the long road to recovery, but decided to give up
	active adventuring,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263052952"></a> at least for the time being.
