	Two weeks later the party left Akhisar for the nearest of the
	Kingdoms of the Five Sisters, and traveled with a caravan
	through the Saddyahi-Ashban, the mountains between the desert
	and the Kingdoms of the Five Sisters.  The caravan was
	attacked twice by bandits during the trip, and every second
	night a member of the caravan was found dead, apparently
	killed by someone in the caravan.  A Jann war party also
	accosted the caravan; they were raiding in retaliation for
	bloody, savage attacks by human bandits, but when they found
	out Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262930600"></a>
	had saved the life of their sheik's
	son<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262931176"></a>
	(from who came the amulet), the Jann allowed the caravan to
	pass, after the party gave their
	oath<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262932088"></a> to track
	down the bandits who killed the Jannee.  Finally, they reached
	the Castle of the Desert Gate (sometimes called Castle Ashban
	by the hasty), at the pass out of the mountains into the
	plains of the Five Sisters.  There the killer was discovered:
	one of the caravan guards was a
	were-tiger,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262932920"></a>
	who went on a rampage through the castle.  In the ensuing
	fight the were-tiger was killed, but several party members
	were infected and Korbel Noir died.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262933608"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262934008"></a>
