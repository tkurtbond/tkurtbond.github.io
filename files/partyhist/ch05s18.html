<p>
	After traveling across the mountains, fleeing with the
	prophet, they entered the gates of Akhisar at dusk and were
	greeted by Abu Darruh<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262959336"></a> one of their friends in the city
	guard.  He told them of the exciting recent occurrences in
	Marv Dashlam, and suggested they put up at the Prophet's
	End,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262960024"></a> an inn of good quality and
	reasonable cost with a reputation for discretion.  Despite the
	ominous name, they decided to do so, as the desert was not
	passable at that time of year, not to mention their ill health
	and general exhaustion.  As it turned out they remained in
	Akhisar for about six months, speaking with the local
	merchants about trade, and working for the city guard.  They
	were visited by a
	Jann,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262961000"></a> who told
	them that the bandits who murdered the Jannee had been killed
	by an Akhisar patrol, so they were freed of that
	oath.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262961672"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	Half-way through their stay, one morning they found an
	eight-armed cross<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262962664"></a> of blood on the floor of the
	common room of their suite at the inn.  During the day they
	learned that other crosses had appeared in many houses
	throughout the city.  Later they were visited by the captain
	of the guard, who told them that the crosses were threats from
	the Arakanisi.  Later, a message arrived from the
	Albad,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262963544"></a> the
	mysterious man<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262964104"></a> who had hired them in Marv
	Dashlam, warning that the priests of that city were still
	looking for them.
      </p>
<p>
	Several nights later, Shay Uvall,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262965208"></a> another resident of the inn and
	sometime merchant and mercenary, saw a stranger coming down
	the stairs from the party's rooms.  The second time he saw
	this happening, he warned the party they were being observed.
	A few days later, an assassination attempt was made on Hajj in
	the market,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262966040"></a> and two days later an assassination
	attempt was made upon all of the
	characters<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262966584"></a> while they slept, unable to wake
	because of an enchantment.  Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262967208"></a> Uvall heard the intruders and came
	to the party's rescue.  He struggle with the assassins until
	his efforts to wake the party succeeded, and together they
	managed to kill the assassins.  During the attack Jamie Molson
	died,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262967976"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262968376"></a> but he had enough money with him
	to be resurrected.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262969368"></a>
	
	It was decided that Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262970664"></a> Uvall will accompany them
	North.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262971240"></a>
