<p>This chapter describes the player characters.</p>
<p><a name="barlow-smythe"></a><b>Barlow Smythe. </b>
	(Ray Smith's first character, deceased.)  Barlow
	Smythe<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262545464"></a>
	died at the Crypts of Stonesboro, heroically holding off the
	enemy while the others escaped.
      </p>
<p><a name="basgoot"></a><b>Basgoot. </b>
	(Larry Wilson's character, transformed.)
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262547640"></a>
	started with a troubled past and has accumulated many more
	problems as time went by, but the greatest of his afflictions
	is his on-again-off-again transformation from human to demonic
	changeling by the powerful demon (see <a class="xref" href="ch05s13.html#narungsdemon">Narung's Demon</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch05s29.html#narungreforged">Narung Reforged</a>)
	imprisoned inside Narung, the powerful magical sword he
	accepted from a ghost.  The demon has apparently learned how
	to stay on the material plane even when <span class="magic">Banished</span> or killed, and so must be
	imprisoned for all time.  Basgoot is also intermittently
	plagued by drunkenness, first brought on by drinking from the
	wineskin of an old man the party met in the same crypts they
	found Narung.  This old man has occasionally appeared
	elsewhere to confuse the party and help Basgoot, including in
	the South.
      </p>
<p><a name="boswt"></a><b>Boswt. </b>
	(Howard Hill's first character, deceased.)
	Boswt<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262552152"></a> died at
	the Stronghold of Sassym by falling down a shaft after
	slipping from slime-covered hand and footholds.
      </p>
<p><a name="bytor"></a><b>Bytor. </b>
	(Vicky Staubly's character, deceased.)
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262554328"></a> was known
	for his anachronistic exclamation `Hot Tub!' and for his
	shades.  He died at the Crypts of Stonesboro and, sadly,
	reappeared later as a zombie re-animated by the necromancer of
	the crypts and fought against his former friends, who killed
	him.
      </p>
<p><a name="cormac-tricerius"></a><b>Cormac Tricerius. </b>
	(Steve Scott's character.)  Cormac
	Tricerius<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262556696"></a> died in an ambush on the way
	to Blackstone Chapel and died again later in its defense, but
	was resurrected each time by the grateful clerics' deity.  In
	Makad-al-Arakan he drank of the Waters of Arakan's Delight,
	acquiring thereby a link to and weakness for Arakan which long
	troubled him and was cured only by
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262557576"></a>,
	the Necromancer of Wolf River.
      </p>
<p><a name="derenedeth"></a><b>Derenedeth. </b>
	(Kurt Bond's character.)
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262559704"></a>
	escaped the round-up of the party that ended in their exile,
	and while the rest of the party vacationed in the south he
	occupied himself with shadowy endeavors in Carzala's
	underworld.  When they returned he provided them with the
	information they needed to revenge themselves on the Judge who
	exiled them, information that enriched them at the same time
	and eventually resulted in their being rewarded with a barony.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262560664"></a>
      </p>
<p><a name="gim-torson"></a><b>Gim Torson. </b>
	(Alan Bond's character.)  Gim Torson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262563000"></a> is an elf who has lived too long
	among humans.  He died in the defense of Blackstone Chapel,
	but was resurrected by the grateful clerics' deity.
	Originally one of the consciences of the party, he has
	latterly become unhesitating and ruthless (just ask the old
	man on the altar in Makad-al-Arakan).  He lost a leg to a
	demon's hunger and anger and gained the nickname
	<span class="personname"><span class="othername">Gimp</span></span>, but
	regained his leg by the magic of
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262564504"></a> the
	necromancer.  Neither he nor Jamie nor Shay nor Basgoot nor
	Cormac can remember what they did for a month to repay the
	necromancer for re-attaching Gim's leg and healing Balour
	Shaw, but they fear the worst.  (After all, he was a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Necromancer</em></span>!)
      </p>
<p><a name="jamie-molson"></a><b>Jamie Molson. </b>
	(Ray Smith's third character.)  Betrayed to the authorities by
	a rival, Jamie Molson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262567272"></a> joined the party when they were
	exiled to the south.  He died while in the south, at the Inn
	of the Prophet's End during an attack by assassins.  Luckily
	his miserly companions found enough money on his person for a
	resurrection.  If it weren't for his tight grasp,
	Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262568088"></a> would
	have ended up with
	Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262568664"></a> in the
	earth below
	Mordraug's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262569240"></a>
	Lair, and he was lucky to get the five fingers thus cut off
	re-attached immediately.  His curiosity is his greatest
	weakness, and his greatest strength.
      </p>
<p><a name="kalo-bibkins"></a><b>Kalo Bibkins. </b>
	(Ray Smith's second character.)  Kalo
	Bibkins<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262571512"></a>
	was a rash but entertaining halfling who caused the party's
	exile to the south and in the process was messily executed for
	theft.  He still troubles the party's sleeping hours (and
	occasionally their waking ones), unable to rest peacefully in
	his grave.  (See <a class="xref" href="ch05s21.html#returningfromthedead">Kalo Bibkins is Back</a>.)
      </p>
<p><a name="korbel-noir"></a><b>Korbel Noir. </b>
	(Howard Hill's second character.)  Korbel
	Noir<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262574408"></a> was
	killed by a were-tiger at Castle Ashban.  He was valiant,
	foolish, suicidal, and given to desecration of just about
	anything, usually by strewing entrails.
      </p>
<p><a name="shay-uvall"></a><b>Shay Uvall. </b>
	(Howard Hill's third character.)  From south of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262576696"></a>,
	Shay Uvall is also valiant, foolish, given to desecration of
	just about anything, usually by strewing entrails; whether he's
	suicidal or not isn't yet known.  He has travelled widely in
	the South as both a merchant and a mercenary.
      </p>
<p><a name="tesla-ramana"></a><b>Tesla Ramana. </b>
	(Karen Elliott's character.)  Tesla
	Ramana<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262579032"></a>
	left adventuring after being crippled by a crate of contraband
	dropped on her during the attack on Smugglers Cove, but has
	applied herself to the equally competitive (if usually less
	violent) world of trade and looks after many of the party's
	day to day business operations.  Her disfiguring injuries have
	started her on a program of surgical and magical alterations
	that seem to be leading beyond mere repair.
      </p>
<p><a name="winther"></a><b>Winther. </b>
	(Matt Elliott's character.)
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262581544"></a> was
	often called the `Band-Aid' by the other members of the party
	because of his healing skills, and fond of debate and reasoned
	discussion, he is the party's bastion of morality in an
	uncertain world.  He feels a sense of duty to better the
	world, and his companions, but suffers occasional dark fits of
	cynicism.  Winther also drank from the wine-sack of that
	wandering madman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262582472"></a> when he appeared to them in the
	South, and thus sometimes seeks refuge in the blood of the
	vine.
      </p>
<p><a name="spear-fodder"></a><b>Spear Fodder. </b>
	(Played by various drop-ins.)  These various visitors
	typically did not survive long.  Such is life, and death.
