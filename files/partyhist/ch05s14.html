	The characters were interviewed by the
	captain<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262916264"></a> of Akhisar's city guard about the
	events in the caves and beyond.  Impressed, he suggested they
	seek work with the city guard, or as warriors of the Bey, the
	local ruler.  The party stayed in Akhisar for a while, getting
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262917048"></a> cured by a sorcerer and
	resting up.
	Basgoot,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262917640"></a>
	unfortunately, remained mind-burnt.
      </p>
<p>
	However, one day they met a ragged old man, seemingly a water
	or wine seller, who quoted poetry (not to their taste) at
	them, offered them a drink from his skin, and spoke to them
	most familiarly and obscurely, saying that he came to help a
	follower fallen on evil times, and asked them to lead him to
	their fallen comrade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262918936"></a> When they did, he gave Basgoot a
	drink, and Basgoot became roaring-and-falling-down drunk.
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262919592"></a> asked
	for a drink, which the old man gladly supplied him, but upon
	drinking Winther fell into stupor and
	unconsciousness.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262920248"></a> Basgoot remained drunk for a
	day, but when he sobered up he had recovered from his
	mind-burn.
      </p>
<p>
	After a few days in the city a
	merchant<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262921608"></a> invited them to visit and talk
	of their journey.  Also impressed, he told them they might
	easily find work for him or for the merchants' council.
      </p>
<p>
	They eventually went to work for the city
	guard.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262923016"></a> After a few weeks patrolling in
	the city, the captain of the guard sent them out to kill some
	monsters that were troubling caravans along the trade route.
	Along the way they rescued a Jann<a href="#ftn.idp140214262924040" class="footnote" name="idp140214262924040"><sup class="footnote">[19]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262924760"></a>
	from a group of Brigands.  The grateful Jann gave
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262925624"></a> an
	amulet.  Tracking the monsters down, they found three Chimera.
	After a fierce battle the party killed the monsters, but
	Tekhadun died (bravely, of course) in the
	fight.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262926344"></a>

	  of June, 1986<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262927864"></a> and the 9th or 10th of July, 1986.
