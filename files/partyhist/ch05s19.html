<p>
	They left Akhisar one day after the second assassination
	attempt, accompanied by Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262974856"></a> Uvall and escorting
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262975416"></a> and three
	merchant emissaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262975976"></a> to the north.  The party
	encountered no serious problems in the southern Gatar
	Shey,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262977272"></a> and
	reached Sev-a-kalam without trouble.
      </p>
<p>
	There the locals warned them that the monsters of the Salt Sea
	were restless.  Nonetheless they set out, and one day as they
	were traveling across a salt flat a huge
	worm-like<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262978440"></a> beast suddenly broke up through the
	ground in front of them, arched over them, and broke back into
	the ground behind them.
      </p>
<p>
	The salt surface between the two holes cracked open and
	dropped the party twenty-five yards into salt water, where
	the huge worm swam leisurely towards the party, obviously
	congratulating itself on the fine breakfast it had found.
	Just then, however, several small boats loomed up out of the
	dark and one of the creatures in them threw an object into
	the water in front of the worm.  The object exploded with an
	impressive noise, blinding flames, and a truly foul stench,
	and the worm left quickly.  The party wished it could too.
      </p>
<p>
	The creatures in the boats seemed much like goblins, only
	nicer, and immediately entered into a heated conversation
	amongst themselves.  When the party figured out the debased
	dialect of Auhaami the creatures were using they discovered
	that the creatures were trying to decide whether the party
	members were intelligent, in which case they should be saved,
	or not, in which case they would provide breakfast and lunch,
	and maybe supper.  After some initial difficulty, the party
	convinced most of the creatures, or
	Jetaleem<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262981000"></a> as
	they called themselves, that they were indeed intelligent.
	(Several Jetaleem remained unconvinced, not surprisingly.)
	Gh'yal,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262981672"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262982072"></a> the leader of the Jetaleem,
	told the party that he would resupply them and lead them to
	the northern edge of the Salt Sea if they would depose
	Moghu,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262983032"></a> the evil
	sorcerous tyrant that was oppressing them.  (Imagine a clean
	goblin.  Imagine a clean goblin spouting Marxist rhetoric.
	Imagine a clean goblin spouting Marxist rhetoric at you as you
	float in a salt lake infested with huge worms that have shown
	a distinct interest in having you for
	breakfast.)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262983880"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	The party, of course, agreed, took the oath,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262984856"></a>
	and snuck into the despot's underground stronghold, where
	they were pestered by an imp and nearly killed by Sand
	Golems. They succeeded, however, in destroying the despot's
	magical talisman, driving both the despot and his Sand
	Golems mad.  The Jetaleem leader kept his word and escorted
	the party safely to the northern edge of the Salt Sea.
      </p>
<p>
	The party headed north to the nearest oasis, hoping that the
	Roc and the Sandwhip that they had found there last time
	would have killed each other off.  However, when they
	reached the ravine where the Sandwhip lived they found the
	bones of the Roc,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262986392"></a>
	and further up the
	ravine the tell-tale depression in the sand of a Sandwhip<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262986984"></a>
	in residence.  Luckily, there was a twenty foot wide area
	between the outermost reach of the Sandwhip and the wall of
	the ravine that our heroes could squeeze through before the
	sandwhip could move to grab them.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262987736" class="footnote" name="idp140214262987736"><sup class="footnote">[20]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p>
	Heading north again, they found that the well in the next
	oasis (which had been filled with the corpses of the Lakal
	tribe the last time they passed through) had been cleared and
	cleaned.  When they reached Tuath's
	Rest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262989176"></a> it
	was obvious that their nomad friends had prospered in their
	new location.  While the party was in the south, several of
	the nomads had scouted the trails up over the Mountain
	Wall,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262989896"></a>
	and found that only the one from
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262990472"></a>
	(over which the characters had originally traveled) was
	passable by animals, and that only barely.  Five of the young
	warriors<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262991144"></a>
	
	had decided to seek fame and fortune, and the party agreed
	to take them north as they go.  The sheik of the tribe also
	mentioned that some of his warriors had seen strange
	creatures seemingly formed of shadow, and on a few occasions
	had been attacked by these creatures.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262992616"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	The party climbed the Mountain Wall and traveled through the
	mountains without incident, but when they entered
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262993672"></a>
	they stumbled directly into another battle amongst the local
	humanoids<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262994280"></a> but escaped without serious
	injury.  Crossing the Vale of Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262994872"></a> they were again accosted by the
	ghosts,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262995448"></a> who demanded a status report.
	When they left the Vale they were attacked by Horse
	Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262996088"></a>
	and driven into the Thornwood
	Forest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262996664"></a> where they soon stumbled into the
	clearing with the tiny hut and Mother
	Thistle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262997304"></a> They spent the night there, and
	she told them of the many changes in the North since they
	left, all bad.
      </p>
<p>
	When they left in the morning they found themselves on the
	North edge of the forest.  When they reached Arn's
	Ferry<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262998472"></a>
	Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262999016"></a> warned them that there had been an
	increase in disorder in Carzala and that the party's journey
	would disrupt the power structure.  Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262999688"></a> agreed to become Balour Shaw's
	apprentice.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263000264"></a>
