	The party left the watchtower and climbed down the cliff to
	the desert.  Once out upon the desert they were attacked by
	strange insect-like humanoids, but managed to defeat them.
	They came to an oasis, but found it inhabited by the
	Kaval-tu-Ata,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262848264"></a>
	a tribe of Auhaami, the nomads of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262848856"></a> (the
	Southern name for the desert).  According to the customs of
	the tribe, they were allowed to enter the oasis after the
	party's champion
	(Basgoot)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262849544"></a>
	defeated the tribe's champion, Harun.  They found out that the
	insect-like humanoids were the
	Thri-Kreen,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262850184"></a>
	a race found in many places on the desert.  The party stayed
	with the tribe for a while.  The sheik,
	Yavidi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262850840"></a> hired
	them to retrieve some religious items, the
	Cup<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262851432"></a> and the
	Talisman,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262851976"></a>
	from
	Batik-al-Yazum,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262852536"></a>
	a local wizard, who had stolen them from the tribe.  In
	return, the sheik offered to outfit them for their journey
	over the desert and to supply a guide, and told them
	Batik-al-Yazum and most of his servants were absent.
      </p>
<p>
	The party accepted, and set out for Batik-al-Yazum's tower in
	Sumaldi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262853768"></a> a
	ruined city and oasis a few days travel away.  They were
	attacked by a party of ghouls in the city, and during the
	fight
	Basgoot's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262854440"></a>
	sword again began to
	hum.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262855000"></a> This
	time, both Basgoot and the ghoul screamed, at the same pitch,
	and Basgoot
	<span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262855896"></a> his armor turned black,
	his skin became the color of yellowed ivory, he grew half a
	foot taller, and the ghoul shriveled up and blew away.  He and
	the sword killed five more ghouls, absorbing each one, and
	then Basgoot attacked Jamie,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262856936"></a> the nearest member of the party,
	slicing through the magical Wall of Force with which
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262857560"></a> had encircled the party.
	Basgoot tried to resist the influence of the sword and the
	rest of the party managed to pull him off Jamie, whereupon he
	collapsed.
      </p>
<p>
	The party continued with its mission, and succeeded in
	reclaiming the Cup and the Talisman, killing several of
	Batik-al-Yazum's servants in the process.  They returned to
	the nomad camp, where they continued learning how to live in
	the desert, how to ride the lizards that were the desert's
	most common form of
	transportation,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262859000"></a>
	and how to speak the language of the South.
