	Until Blackstone Chapel<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263404296"></a> (twenty miles into the South
	Downs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263404888"></a>),
	the road is passable without much trouble, and suitable for
	carts and wagons, excepting a few trouble spots.  However,
	within five miles the road after the chapel has disappeared
	completely except for almost unnoticable traces.  The rangers
	were able to follow those traces without too many problems.
	Eighty miles beyond Blackstone Chapel the traces lead into a
	medium-sized valley, about 1 mile long and a quarter to half a
	mile wide.  The far end of the valley forks, dividing east and
	south.  Streams run down each of the forks into the center of
	the valley where there is a large pond.  A large stream
	empties this pool and runs out of the valley through the end
	the party entered the valley (the northwest end).  Beside the
	pool is a ruin, little more than foundation outlines and a
	pile of stones.
      </p>
<p>
	The party took the east fork and traveled about fifteen miles
	until they came to a tree surrounded by wolves.  In the tree
	was perched a three foot tall near-human (of an unknown race),
	which the party rescued.  It turned out he was the chief of a
	tribe, and in gratitude he invited them back to his home cave
	for a feast.  The party agreed, and accompanied them to the
	cave (were there were two hundred or so little
	people<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263407080"></a>), where they were served fine
	food and and absolutely the best ale they had ever tasted.
	However, after most of the party had nodded off they were
	attacked by the Little People.  The party bravely fought off
	the attack and managed to escape the cave complex, capturing
	the chief along the way.  The chief was killed during the
	escape, but one of the party,
	Bere<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263407992"></a> (pronounced
	bear), carried the body along and after reaching a safe place
	he cut out the
	heart<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263408632"></a>
	of the chief and ate it.  It made him sick for several days.
      </p>
<p>
	They travelled about fifteen more miles and came to a deep,
	swift, and fairly wide mountain streem that they found
	uncrossable.  In the middle of the stream is a large rock
	which looks as if it may have at one time supported a
	bridge<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263410136"></a>.
	This stream is also inhabited by a large monster, which the
	party glimpsed only briefly.  Though they did explore upstream
	several miles, they did not find any better places to cross,
	so they returned to the fork in the valley and took the south
	branch.
      </p>
<p>
	Following the south branch, they were surrounded by a
	tribe<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263411656"></a>
	of humans with stone and bronze weapons.  The party managed to
	convince the tribesmen that the party was not hostile, and
	became somewhat friendly with them.  These tribesmen mentioned
	that there were several tribes in the mountains, and that all
	the others were hostile.  They were greatly curious about the
	iron weapons of the party members, for iron weapons were only
	legends to them.
      </p>
<p>
	About twenty miles from the fork the party came to cliff-face.
	Only a rough footpath (not sufficient for pack animals, but
	adequate for careful climbers) is left on the cliff-face
	itself.  While they were climbing the footpath, they came
	abreast of a cave mouth, in which appeared a mad-looking old
	man yelling <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Who are you?</span>”</span> This
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263414264"></a>
	promptly fell out of the cave mouth, yelling <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Now what
	<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> that spell…</span>”</span> A little
	while later he came climbing bck up to them, covered in white
	feathers.  He tagged along with the party after that.  He did
	not know the mountains, answering the party's questions in
	that direction with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Haven't the foggiest!  I've never
	been here before in my life!</span>”</span> He did help them a couple
	of times by lighting the evening fire with a Fireball spell,
	though.  After the clif-face they descended through the
	mountains for twenty miles until they reached the Vale of
	Morin.
      </p>
<p>
	When the party crossed the Vale of
	Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263417256"></a>
	they were accosted by
	Ghosts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263417816"></a> twice;
	both times they were asked if they were working to establish a
	trade route, the ghosts saying <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">we were promised this so
	our souls could rest.</span>”</span> The party replied that they were
	surveying for the trade route.
      </p>
<p>
	When the party reached
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263419400"></a>
	they found that, although the
	humanoids<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263419976"></a>
	were not having one of their frequent wars in the ruins, there
	<span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span> many of them in the surrounding
	mountains, and in the city itself.  The ruins of Korsepolis
	are nestled in the mouth of a valley, through which runs the
	road into the Mountain Wall.  The ruins completely fill the
	mouth of the valley, and a a half a mile wide or more.  In the
	center of the city is an
	area<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263421304"></a> that has been cleared of
	ruins and leveled by the humanoids.  They piled the stones
	around the cleared area, making a circular mound around it,
	and many are living in it (about 150 to 200).  Other than the
	watch around the central area, the humanoids do not seem to
	keep careful watch on the city, patrolling only once every
	three or four days or so.  In the city there are ruins of what
	must have once been a small
	fort<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263422552"></a>
	which could be rebuilt relatively easily.  It seems to be
	newer than the rest of the ruins, and was built using rubble
	frmo the city.  There are also two
	towers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263423528"></a>
	of the same sort in different areas of the city that could be
	rebuilt.  The humanoids seem to avoid these areas for some
	reason, not coming close to them on their patrols through the
	city.  After observing the city for a while BAMF sneaked
	through undetected and continued to the Watchtower.
      </p>
<p>
	When BAMF reached the
	Watchtower<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263425080"></a>
	they found twenty-five
	Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263425656"></a>
	camped around there.  The Watchtower itself seemed in good
	shape, and had not been entered.  The Auhaami asked who the
	party was and what it was doing, and when told it was working
	for the explorers who came through several months ago three
	Auhaami decided to accompany them back to Seagate with a
	message.
      </p>
<p>
	On the way back through Korsepolis the party ran into a small
	group of orcs, which they managed to destroy.  They left the
	city hurriedly before any other orcs found them.
      </p>
<p>
	On the return leg of the journey the party was attacked by
	Horse Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263427560"></a>
	and several people were severely injured.  While the old
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263428168"></a> held off
	the nomads with an odd assortment of spells the party
	retreated into the
	Thronewood<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263429080"></a>,
	where they were found by an old woman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263429656"></a>.  The old woman and the old man
	healed the injured party members, while arguing constantly
	over everything while they were together.
      </p>
<p>
	When the party reached the Brastor Holding the old man left
	them.  The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful, except
	for several short battles with bandits along the roads in the
	Atrusian Hills<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263430920"></a>.
      </p>
<p>
	The total time for the journey was 83 days, but the rangers
	estimate that travel time through the South
	Downs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263431976"></a> and
	the East Bounders would be fifteen to sixteen days.
