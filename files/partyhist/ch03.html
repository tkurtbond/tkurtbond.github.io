      </p>
<p><a name="amur-gibbetsmaster"></a><b>Amur Gibbetsmaster. </b>
	Amur Gibbetsmaster,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262590888"></a> the hanging judge of Seagate, exiled the
	party with a geas to explore the South to further his own
	nefarious schemes.  Upon their return from the South the
	party was instrumental in his own downfall and eventual hanging.
      </p>
<p><a name="balour-shaw"></a><b>Balour Shaw. </b>
	(Crazed no longer, just missing.)  A mysterious mage, sometime
	mentor of Gim Torson and once insane and in the custody of the
	party, Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262593304"></a> was cured by
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262593864"></a> the
	necromancer and has since disappeared, telling the party
	they're responsible for Carzala's survival now — he has
	better things to do.
      </p>
<p><a name="beggar-king"></a><b>Beggar King. </b>
	This evil being<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262596200"></a>lives in the sewers and tunnels
	below Seagate, and controls all of the beggars who live in and
	around Seagate.  He is an occasional enemy of the party
	because of their intrusions into his domain.
      </p>
<p><b>Brandon Marec. </b>
	Brandon Marec<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262598120"></a> is
	the captain of the Seagate city guards, a vicious bully, and a
	follower of Tathlam Dargan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262598744"></a>, the Baron of Seagate.  Brandon
	has a special place in his heart for the party, and it's not
	somewhere anyone would want to visit.
      </p>
<p><b>Camlost. </b>
	Captain of one of the party's ships,
	Camlost<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262600632"></a> is a
	very severe and ascetic human, tall, dark, and dour.  While
	not well liked by his men, they have tremendous respect for
	his skill and his courage.  Not much is known about his
	history before he started working the trade routes from
	Carzala to the North ten years ago.
      </p>
<p><b>Cleirach. </b>
	(Pronounced <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cleary</span>”</span>.)  The main engineer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262603064"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262603992"></a>
	hired by the
	party to build the road, Cleirach is a small man, very quick
	physically and mentally both.  He is full of strong
	opinions.  He learned his trade in the North, in the Broken
	Lands<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262604728"></a>, and in the Confederacy, where he also worked on
	civilian projects.
      </p>
<p><b>Corvious Dark-blade. </b>
	A skilled weapons-master who runs a private weapons training
	establishment in Seagate, Corvious
	Darkblade<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262606888"></a> was Barlow Smythe's first
	contact in Carzala.  His cognomen comes from the strange blade
	of dark metal that he carries.  Corvious has an enviable
	reputation as someone <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to anger, and
	various rumors abound that the fencing academy he runs is
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> his real business.
      </p>
<p><b>Daffyd ap Hugh. </b>
	Captain of the Count's courier vessel, the <span class="name">Seaswift</span>, Daffyd ap
	Hugh<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262610408"></a>
	is the intelligent young man who escorted the characters back
	to Smugglers' Cove when they returned to retrieve their ships.
      </p>
<p><b>Delath Lorven. </b>
	The Count of Seagate.
      </p>
<p><b>Dohraoul. </b>
	Dohraoul<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262613464"></a> is
	the Knight of Theris<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262614024"></a> who escorted the party off the
	soil of Carzala via Chapel Crossing<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262614648"></a> at the border of the Brastor
	Holding and the Sea of Grass.  He was a grim man who behaved
	politely to the party members because, as he explained upon
	first meeting them, he thought they had been dishonorably
	treated — they should have been allowed to die with
	their honor and dignity intact.  He was also the first to
	welcome the party back to civilization and Carzala when they
	crossed back into the Brastor Holding at Chapel Crossing on
	their return journey.
      </p>
<p><b>Dhairrhuwyth. </b>
	A wizard who lived in Seagate and was friends with Balour Shaw.
	Helped the party disrupt the Arkanian's attempt to call up
	Arakan at Finn's Waste.
      </p>
<p><b>Dulinn Wiell. </b>
	Dulinn Wiell<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262618664"></a> is the party's merchant factor in
	Seagate, finding cargoes for the party's ships and selling the
	incoming cargoes.
      </p>
<p><b>Evan. </b>
	A strange, gray, enormously strong dwarf-like being who was
	rescued by the party from a spider web in the Caves at
	Smugglers' Cove,
	Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262620632"></a> has a
	definite affinity for stone and has proven himself a masterly
	weapon-smith, reforging Narung with the help of Chelm and
	Bolg.  He was last seen wandering south through the Atrusian
	hills, leaving the party (in disgust?) after their escape from
	the stronghold of the (unjustly?) murdered Necromancer,
	Mordraug.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262621496"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Gerrod. </b>
	A marine sergeant whom the party lost in the Spider
	Hall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262623256"></a> in
	the caves behind Smugglers' Cove and then rescued from the
	Arkanians at Finn's Waste,
	Gerrod<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262623896"></a> was
	foolishly grateful for the rescue and asked the Count to
	retire him into the party's service.  He now is the so-called
	`butler' of the party, when their house isn't exploded and
	burned to the ground, and has proved an invaluable servant and
	ally, as well as a invaluable source of knowledge about the
	Carzala military.
      </p>
<p><b>Gh'yal. </b>
	Gh'yal<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262625960"></a> was the
	leader of the Jetaleem, and is the one the party has to thank
	for convincing the other Jetaleem that they were indeed
	intelligent, and would not be a suitable breakfast snack.  He
	also talked the party into killing the evil wizard
	Moghu<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262626744"></a> in return
	for an escort to the north side of the Salt Sea.
      </p>
<p><b>Girfalath. </b>
	The captain of one of the party's ships,
	Girfalath<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262628888"></a>
	is an Elf, completely frivolous when off duty, but completely
	serious when on duty or on his ship.
      </p>
<p><b>Hajj. </b>
	A true Prophet,
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262630728"></a> was rescued
	(or kidnapped, depending on your viewpoint) by the party from
	the danger of assassination south of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262631400"></a> at
	the request of the ruler of Marv Dashlam and brought north to
	safety.  His politics and philosophy tend to offend the
	priests of most religions, emphasizing reason and equality as
	they do, and it is hard to decide if he is a holy man, a
	philosopher or a troublemaker.
      </p>
<p><b>Harun. </b>
	Harun<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262633400"></a> was the tribal
	champion<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262633960"></a> of
	the Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262634520"></a>
	that Basgoot defeated in the Auhaami tradition so that the
	party might enter an oasis in the party's first encounter with
	the Auhaami of the Gatar Shey.
      </p>
<p><b>Ilene. </b>
	A beautiful young woman rescued from an enchanted sleep in a
	underground stronghold in the wilderness at the behest of
	Balour Shaw,
	Ilene<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262636536"></a> is
	rebuilding Balour Shaw's tower, helped by a group of
	untalkative
	Dwarves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262637160"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Karl Blue-tooth. </b>
	Karl Blue-tooth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262638888"></a> was the guide the party hired
	to help them find the source of the Wolf River in search of
	Mordraug.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262639544"></a>
	His unpleasant personality and crude personal habits ensured
	that the party did not grieve when he did not return from the
	journey, after he had abandoned them near their destination.
      </p>
<p><b>The Mage. </b>
	The party has offended this powerful
	mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262641496"></a> on
	several occassions.  They really have no idea who he is or
	what he is about, although he seems to be involved with
	Suliman Trade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262642168"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Melthal Heavy-hand. </b>
	Melthal Heavy-hand<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262643912"></a> is a recently retired army
	officer who ranked high in the Count of Carzala's service, and
	who still retains numerous friends there.  He was Basgoot's
	first contact in Carzala.  He is a gruff and testy person
	whose trust is not easily won.  He lives on a large farm with
	his family somewhere not far from Seagate.
      </p>
<p><b>Moghu. </b>
	Moghu<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262645976"></a> was a
	tyrannical evil wizard and ruler and the creator of the Sand
	Golems;<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262646584"></a>
	the party slew him to free the
	Jetaleem.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262647160"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Mordraug. </b>
	A powerful necromancer and healer who lived in seclusion in a
	stronghold he gained from the
	Dwarves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262649368"></a> in
	olden times for healing their king,
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262649896"></a> was
	sought out by the party to replace Gim's missing leg and heal
	Balour Shaw's mental and physical injuries.  The party paid
	for this with a month of their lives, which they do not
	remember.  He later caused
	Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262650648"></a> to be
	reforged and helped imprison the demon in the sword, but was
	foully murdered immediately afterward by Basgoot, fulfilling a
	bargain made with
	Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262651336"></a>, the
	orcish-named Dwarf who also helped reforge Narung.
      </p>
<p><b>Mother Thistle. </b>
	An old woman living alone in a cottage deep in the Thornwoood
	Forest, Mother Thistle<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262653208"></a> help heal the party.
      </p>
<p><b>The Necromancer. </b>
	The party has offended this powerful
	necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262655000"></a> on several occassions.  They
	really don't know who he is or what he is about.
      </p>
<p><b>Polam Wesved. </b>
	A rich land holder in the Brastor Holding,
	<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262656856"></a> became
	an enemy of the party.
      </p>
<p><b>Selye Storm-watcher. </b>
	Selye Storm-watcher<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262658648"></a> is a prosperous, if
	eccentric, resident of Gurgnir's Hope who was Cormac
	Tricerius's first contact in Carzala.  Although his adventures
	have made him plenty of money, he still spends much of his
	time adventuring or exploring the lands around Carzala, often
	alone.  His name comes from his habit of wandering around in
	and watching storms, especially violent ones.
      </p>
<p><b>Rayesta. </b>
	A nomad girl from the Sea of Grass,
	Rayesta<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262660792"></a> was
	trading in the Brastor Holding when Polam Wesved tried to
	abduct her.  She fled to Blackstone Chapel, where the PCs held
	off several attacks by Wesved's thugs.
      </p>
<p><b>Remy Gill<a href="#ftn.idp140214262662280" class="footnote" name="idp140214262662280"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>. </b>
	A very young Elf, Remy Gill<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262663432"></a> is nonetheless a very accomplished
	military
	engineer,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262664024"></a> having worked on both sides in
	many seiges.
      </p>
<p><b>Slehad. </b>
	Slehad<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262666072"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262666472"></a> was the quirky and interesting
	Fire Giant who entertained the party in his tower overlooking
	the cliffs of the Mountain Wall and the Gatar Shey.
	Unfortunately for the party, he turned out to have disturbing
	habits and dietary tastes and human and elvish corpses in his
	larder.
      </p>
<p><b>Steffan. </b>
	A young officer in the Count's court,
	Steffan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262668536"></a> is a
	pleasant young man with a taste for gambling and intrigue, but
	he is extremely devoted to the Count, who trusts him with
	difficult assignments.  Steffan is probably one of the party's
	best supporters at court.
      </p>
<p><b>Tathlam Dargan. </b>
	The Baron of Seagate, Tathlam Dargan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262670520"></a> is an
	enemy of the party, in part because of their disruption of his
	once peaceful community, in part due to their actions towards
	Amur Gibbetsmaster, and no doubt in part for other
	reasons.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262671256" class="footnote" name="idp140214262671256"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Tamhas. </b>
	Tamhas<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262673736"></a> was the
	captain of one of the detachments of marines that accompanied
	the party back to Smugglers' Cove to retrieve the ships and
	their cargo.
      </p>
<p><b>Tekhadun. </b>
	(Deceased.)  A dwarf who was forced to join the party when
	they were geased to travel to the Kingdoms of the Five
	Sisters,
	Tekhadun<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262675736"></a> was
	bad-tempered and prideful, but a master of the axe.  He died
	in the south, killed while fighting a Chimera.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262676392" class="footnote" name="idp140214262676392"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Tully Glas. </b>
	Tully Glas<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262678440"></a>
	is the party's factotum<a href="#ftn.idp140214262679000" class="footnote" name="idp140214262679000"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a>

      their trading business, as well as whatever else comes up.
      </p>
<p><b>Tychel. </b>
        Head priest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262681592"></a>

<p><b>Uillean Kawiyr. </b>
	Uillean Kawiyr<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262683384"></a> was the captain of one of the
	detachments of marines that accompanied the party back to
	Smugglers' Cove to retrieve the ships and their cargo.
      </p>
<p><b>Ulfred. </b>
	Ulfred<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262685256"></a> is
	another of the military
	engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262685832"></a>
	that the party hired to build the road.  He is a very short
	but very broad man, his hair beginning to grey, with a short
	steel-grey beard.
      </p>
<p><b>Vlad Sharp-knife. </b>
	Vlad Sharp-knife<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262688136"></a> is a prosperous merchant
	based in Crystal Springs who was Gim Torson's first contact in
	Carzala.  He has suggested the party to several persons
	looking for adventurers to do jobs, has helped them find
	merchants who might be interested in the South and helping
	build the road, and has acted as a consultant to help the
	party get their merchant company started.  He is extremely
	curious, but now that he is getting older he usually leaves
	the adventuring to others.  His name comes from the many
	daggers he invariable carries, some concealed, that he has
	been known to use on those who try to cheat him.
      </p>
<p><b>Yavidi. </b>
	Yavidi<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262690488"></a> is the

	  Originally the position of Baron of
	  Seagate was traditionally given to one of the Count of
	  Carzala's younger sons, and the Baron worked closely with
	  the Count.  However, at one point in the past the position
	  went to one of the Count's daughters, a very unusual woman,
	  and when she died the position was given to her husband, a
	  very popular member of court, and when he died it was given
	  to his son by his first wife.  Thus eventually it was
	  inherited (more-or-less) by Tathlam Dargan.
