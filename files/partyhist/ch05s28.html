<p>
	  Most of the characters were out walking late one very foggy
	  evening, looking for a their favorite late-night tavern.
	  They entered the Little Bazaar, which was oddly clear of the
	  thick fog elsewhere omnipresent, when suddenly a familiar
	  voice yelled out for them to stop.  When they do, they heard
	  their own voices coming out of the fog.  The voices
	  harranged them for their past deeds, and warned them that
	  now they must be punished.  Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263151864"></a> was offered a chance to join
	  them, and
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263152472"></a> was
	  warned that he was selected out for eternal torment.  Then a
	  duplicate of each of the characters stepped out of the fog.
	  After a difficult fight they killed all of the duplicates
	  (at least, they <span class="emphasis"><em>thought</em></span> they killed the
	  duplicates...), but then the fog itself attacked them, and
	  proved impervious to their weapons.  (How do you fight
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>fog</em></span>?)
	</p>
<p>
	  Noticing that the fog thinned the further from the ground one
	  went, they climbed up to the roof tops above the fog, which
	  they found to be concentrated in a circle around the bazaar.
	  The fog went berserk and began destroying buildings and
	  killing anything in its path.  They noticed a thick cord of
	  silvery mist that led away from the fog, and followed it
	  back to a warehouse.
	</p>
<p>
	  Inside the warehouse were several hundred Arkanian
	  worshipers, kneeling and chanting, led by several priests.
	  From their bodies rose a haze that solidified into fog above
	  them and then twined into the silvery fog cord that the
	  party had followed to the building.  Outside,
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263155688"></a>
	  drew the remains of
	  Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263156264"></a>
	  (which he had carefully, perhaps obsessively, carried with
	  him since it was broken) and cut the silvery cord of fog.
	  Narung sucked magical energy from the cord, and there was a
	  huge explosion and an earthquake; ninety percent of the
	  worshipers were killed and Basgoot was knocked unconscious.
	  (Again.)  The party observed that the stump of Narung was
	  noticeably longer than before.  
	</p>
<p>
	  The party returned to the Bazaar where they disposed of the
	  bodies of their assailants in magical fire in a well, and
	  then returned to their house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263158136"></a> where they found that the
	  characters who had remained there had also been attacked.
	  Later the party learned that several members of the Court
	  were in the warehouse when it collapsed, and that the
	  warehouse was owned by Suliman
	  Trade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263158920"></a>

<p>
	  Balour Shaw's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263162664"></a> amnesia and madness continued,
	  and he had to be constantly looked after, a task made more
	  difficult by the spells he randomly cast.  Late one evening
	  he was more unsettled than usual, but finally was calmed
	  down by staring into the fire, a pastime he greatly enjoyed.
	  (Ah, how the mighty are fallen.)  Suddenly he yelled, threw
	  something into the fire, and peered closely into the fire;
	  whatever he saw frightened him and he jumped back screaming,
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Come on, come on!  We've got to see the Wizard!</span>”</span>
	</p>
<p>
	  Shaw led the party on a wild goose chase through the streets
	  of Seagate and then through the
	  sewers,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263164600"></a> half
	  of the time giggling and laughing and half of the time
	  screaming something about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">idiots</span>”</span>.  They followed him
	  through the sewers till long after dark, picking up
	  Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263165720"></a>
	  Bibkins on the way, until they finally caught up to him.
	  Shaw pointed them to a secret door that disclosed a trapped
	  tunnel leading into what was obviously an abandoned mage's
	  workroom.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263166456"></a>
	</p>
<p>
	  Once in the room a spell was tripped, and it was magically
	  sealed, trapping the party.  In the center of the room was a
	  shimmering dome, which turned out to contain a
	  demon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263167576"></a> and
	  when the party investigated they found that the dome was
	  about to collapse.  Luckily the demon was also inside a
	  pentagram that would hold it for a while longer, but when
	  the characters figured out how to banish the demon they
	  found that the tools they needed were inside the pentagram
	  with the demon.  They planned carefully, and when the dome
	  collapsed Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263168504"></a> Torson rushed out and pitched
	  the tools to those outside the pentagram.  Unfortunately,
	  the demon caught Gim by the leg, and proceeded to chew it
	  off.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263169208"></a> An attack by the other characters
	  distracted him long enough for Gim to break free, and they
	  were able to perform the banishment.
	</p>
<p>
	  Afterwards, they eventually figured out how to get out of
	  the room, and traversed a secret door upward to another
	  chamber and then exited to the cellar of a house,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263170728"></a> which
	  turned out to be a slum area.  They fled the area, dragging
	  the injured with them.
	</p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	    The players left the Bell, the Book, and the Candle in the
	    workroom.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263172792"></a>
