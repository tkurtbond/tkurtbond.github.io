      This campaign never really ended, but the geographical dispersal
      of the players eventually caused it to sink into quiescence.
      Still, with 30 adventures over several more sessions than that,
      it lasted pretty well.  It looks like there were 5 adventures in
      1985, 15 adventures in 1986, 2 adventures in 1987, 5 adventures
      in 1988, 2 adventures in 1989, 2 adventures in 1992, and 2
      adventures in 1994.  Several of the players graduated from
      college in 1986, if I remember correctly, and left the area for
      jobs.  In the later years we played at Thanksgiving and
      Christmas, when the players returned to the area on 
      holidays.  After that things began to get too difficult to
      schedule. 
    </p>
<p>
      There were plenty of things left for the players to do:
      finishing the road, developing their barony,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263345384"></a> fighting humanoids
      along the Mountain Wall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263346232"></a>, trade caravans to the south,
      fighting The Mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263346840"></a> and The
      Necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263347400"></a>, and so forth.
    </p>
<p>
      I was surprised, looking back, at how many player characters,
      and how many important non-player characters, died during this
      campaign, or were severely wounded.
    </p>
<p>
      At some point I'd like to revisit this campaign, but frankly at
      this point in my life I'm not sure I'd be interested in doing it
      in either <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em> or
      <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em> (my tastes lately run to simpler
      rules systems), and I'm not sure converting things
      to yet another system would be worth it.  (At the time, I was
      maintaining the <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em> character sheets
      using the original <a class="link" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html" target="_top">MakeChar</a>;
      I've no idea what the modern equivalents are like.)
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, looking back at the box of index cards I used to keep
      NPC and monster stats I see that my typical <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263352200"></a> NPC or
      monster easily fit on the front of one index card, and are in
      general remarkably simple.  Really, <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263353128"></a>'s complexity comes
      during character creation, and then only for characters that you
      are detailing to the level of a PC, something you'd only do for
      a major villian; for everybody else you just pick the numbers
      you want.
    </p>
<p>
      In 2007 I revisited to this setting briefly with a
      <em class="citetitle">Savage Worlds</em> adventure for my daughter,
      niece, nephews, and one of the original players.  It was fun to
      see the original players eyes get big when he realized where
      this new adventure was taking place.  And the adventure itself
      was fun, so I reckoned it was successful on both levels.
