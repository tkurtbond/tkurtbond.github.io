<p>C.P. said: “I want a <em>dis</em>-integrated development envronment, not an
integrated development environment.”  I agree.</p>
<p>Microsoft's IDEs have always been about you adapting your working
style to their rigid idea of how that work should be done using their
monolithic tools.  Eclipse promises to let you add whatever
functionality you want to Eclipse, as long as you use their API (and
tools) and are willing to write a million lines of code.</p>
<p>That's not what I want.</p>
<p>I want to use the tools I find suitable to the job, and stitch them
together easily.  I want tools that work together, not get pasted
together.</p>

<p>I ran a short game of <em>Buggin'</em> with L.B., T.A., E.A., and M.A.  Their
bugs were at an opera premier (in a suitably rustic setting: the opera
house was made of thick grass stalks covered with leaves, with doors
of bark fragments) when some thugs tried to abduct a young lady VIP
bug.  They, of course, prevented it.  M.A. kept getting knocked onto
the stage, and every time he'd try to sing.  Eventually he sang so
badly that things started breaking and falling down around the
characters.</p>
<p>There's more to the story, but we didn't have time to take it any
further.  We'll pick it up again later.</p>

<p>I've been hearing a lot of people saying, in effect, that 4E D&amp;D
admits what kind of game D&amp;D has always been and tunes everything for
that: butt-kicking tactical battle-mat kick-in-the-door, kill
everything, and take it's stuff gamist play. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#whatpodcast" id="id1">1</a> Right now
I'm ignoring the later bit about what 4E does and how well it does it,
and looking at the earlier bit's claims about “the kind of game D&amp;D
has always been”.  I'm not convinced.</p>
<p>This post, right now, is sort of a placeholder.  I intend to fill in
my history with D&amp;D and look at the various editions of D&amp;D that I've
got and see if they support the “the kind of game D&amp;D has always been”
remark.</p>
<p>As I've said <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/10/01/triad-odnd-tekumel-tnt/">elsewhere</a> the release of 4E and the choruses of “It's
not real D&amp;D” actually got me interested me in looking back at what
D&amp;D really was, so I bought PDFs of Original D&amp;D (from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/">RPGNow</a>
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#wotc-kerfluffle" id="id2">2</a>) and its supplements and Chainmail and printed
them all out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the
original form factor.  I've read <cite>Chainmail</cite> and the three pamphlets
that made up the original D&amp;D release (X, Y, Z) completely, and have
scanned the others.  (Oddly enough, I've still not got beyond scanning
4E.)</p>
<div class="section" id="od-d">
<h2>OD&amp;D</h2>
<p>The original version of D&amp;D, along with some of its supplements, was
still available in some hobby shops when I started playing RPGs, but
the group I played with had was strictly AD&amp;D, so I completely missed
out playing the original, as well as its follow-ons, the various
versions of Basic D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Some of the retrogaming community has commented that the play
experience for this for this version of D&amp;D is very different from all
versions that came after it.  From my initial reading, I agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blue-box-holmes-d-d">
<h2>Blue Box/Holmes D&amp;D</h2>
<p>I got this boxed set for Christmas one year as a young teenager, and
was fascinated.  My box came with B2 — The Keep on the Borderlands.
The group I ended up with, however, played AD&amp;D.  I think I ran this a
couple of times for my younger brother.  My original copy of the
rulebook walked off many years ago, but I picked up the reproduction
cheap a year or so after the anniversary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moldvay-cook-basic-expert-d-d">
<h2>Moldvay/Cook Basic/Expert D&amp;D</h2>
<p>I saw this in stores as a teenager, but never picked it up.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of the rulebooks (from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nobleknight.com/">Noble Knight</a>) at some point,
and can see why so many speak so fondly of it.  It is a clear, well
written presentation of the ideas from OD&amp;D with the unevenness sanded
down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-d-d-1e">
<h2>Advanced D&amp;D, 1E</h2>
<p>This was my real introduction to roleplaying games, and continued as
the main game in the groups where I played until college, with
occasional bouts of Tunnels and Trolls.  We played mostly homegrown
campaigns; for some reason the AD&amp;D modules didn't work as well for
us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="red-box-mentzer-d-d">
<h2>Red Box/Mentzer D&amp;D</h2>
<p>I never got a chance to play Red Box, but I got the PDFs from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/">RPGNow</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-cyclopedia-d-d">
<h2>Rules Cyclopedia D&amp;D</h2>
<p>I heard a lot of folks extolling the virtues of the one-book RC D&amp;D,
so I searched around a found a reasonably priced copy.  Well worth the
money.  This is without a doubt the most complete-in-one-book version
of D&amp;D, at least until the <a class="reference external" href="pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone">retro-clones</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-d-d-2e">
<h2>Advanced D&amp;D, 2E</h2>
<p>When 2E came out I'd long since moved on from D&amp;D, and had been
playing <em>DragonQuest</em> and <em>GURPS</em> for long while.  I played 2E very
briefly, just before 3E came out, with a guy who'd been on a 3E
playtest and hated it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="e-d-d">
<h2>3E D&amp;D</h2>
<p>Completely missed playing this at the time, but have played a few
sessions during the 3.5E era with folks who played 3E.</p>

<p>So, for grins and giggles, last time my local gaming group met I
brought copies of the first three commercially published roleplaying
games for show and tell: Original <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>; <em>Empire of the
Petal Throne</em>; and <em>Tunnels and Trolls</em>.  (The order of the last two
is debatable.)</p>
<p>The release of 4E and the choruses of “It's not real D&amp;D” had actually
interested me in looking back at what D&amp;D really was, so I bought PDFs
of Original D&amp;D (from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/">RPGNow</a>) and its supplements and printed them all
out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the original
form factor.</p>
<p>Listening to the Whartson Hall Gamers playing <em>Empire of the Petal
Throne</em> from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgmp3.com/">RPGMP3</a> Community Podcast rekindled my interesting in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tekumel.com/">Tékumel</a>, so I bought a PDF of it from RPGNow and printed it.  (This
really drove home how much bigger and better presented EPT was than
OD&amp;D.  Also, how even less Politically Correct it was.)</p>
<p>And <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_and_Trolls">T&amp;T</a> had been in my thoughts since Ron Edwards' wrote a series
of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6272">reports</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6355">on</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7104">his</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7863">T&amp;T</a> game.  I played T&amp;T a bit in my youth,
so I already had a copy of it, the 5th edition, so I let that stand in
for the 1st edition, a not unreasonable bit of flexibility, since T&amp;T
seems to have changed much less over five editions than D&amp;D did over
4.5 or so.</p>
<p>(Later: I can't imagine why I didn't bring my copy of FFE/QLI's
republication of the original Traveller Books 1, 2, and 3 along, and
have one of the first SF RPGs too!)</p>

<h4>Actual Play</h4>
<div class="section" id="drinking-before-the-festival">
<h5>Drinking before the festival</h5>
<p>It was the night before the spring festival, and the four friends
began the night at the local tavern, the <em>Broken Stone</em>, chattering
about the festival and what competitions they wanted to enter. A long
time rival of Onchu, Halrig (sp?) Hillfield came over and began
chaffing Onchu about the wrestling competition the next day, which
lead to Eirnin wagering 2 c.p. on Onchu vs. Halrig and Bartha treating
Halrig to a couple of drinks to continue him on his way to a
hangover. After that the friends moved outside to the pre-festival
celebrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="out-of-town-ruffians">
<h5>Out-of-town ruffians</h5>
<p>One or more of the friends noticed three out-of-town ruffians forcing
young Lochlan a'Niall down a street and behind a building, and when
shouting for Niall gave no result, the friends hurried after the
youngster and ruffians. By the time the ruffians were in sight again
they hand young Lochlan up against the building side and were beating
his precious coins out of him. Eirnin ran forward and got between the
wee lad and his attacker, the leader of the thugs, and got him to run
and find Sheriff Artair, while the others moved up and engaged the
hoodlums, one of whom brandished a club and attacked them. Droston, in
a rage, began beating the leader with a stick of firewood, while the
others looked to his followers. By the time Niall and Sheriff Artair
arrived the leader was bleeding on the ground, one thug had run off in
fright and the other had surrendered. After interrogating everyone
involved the Sheriff told the friends that they had done well and
carted the leader and the thug off to a root cellar for the rest of
the festival where they were joined the next day by the other thug,
found shivering on the doorstep of the Broken Stone after being
frightened out of the woods. (It turns out that Droston had really
done a number on the leader, broken bones and smashed his face enough
he was possibly looking at losing an eye. Nobody cared.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-festival">
<h5>The Festival</h5>
<p>The next day the wrestling competition was first in line. Onchu made
it through the necessary eliminations to fight Halrig Hillfield and
after a tense match won handily. Halrig, after recovering, declared it
was a good match and that he'd win next year, and paid Eirnin his 2
c.p. winnings without complaint. Continuing on the competition Onchu
was matched in the final bout with Coll, the reigning village
champion, and while he lost that bout Coll opined that Onchu had been
one of the best challenges he'd had for a while and with a few more
years under his belt would be a very interesting match.</p>
<p>After that Bartha won the sprint contest, and poor Onchu, barely
recovered from his bout with Coll, came in last. (Droston was
impressed that he was able to run at all after matching up with Coll!)</p>
<p>Eirnin won the distance run!</p>
<p>Droston was the runner-up in the Archery meet.</p>
<p>Eirnin came in third on the log chop.</p>
<p>Droston won the axe throw!</p>
<p>Bartha was the runner-up in the sling competition.</p>
<p>After that the friends just enjoyed the rest of the festival.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-to-work-on-monday">
<h5>Back to work on Monday</h5>
<p>The Monday after the festival, everybody went back to work. Droston
and Bartha were off hunting separately while Eirnan and Onchu were
setting out for work. Along the way, Bran McVoy of the Clan McVoy came
up to Eirnin and offered him a job running two of the McVoy wagons
into town, eventually offering Eirnin and Onchu 8 silver a piece, take
it or leave it, no damn bargaining because he'd just go and find the
next guy. Eirnin and Onchu accepted, Onchu cleared his day off with
his shift boss, promising 5 copper under the table, and they set off
to gather their gear and meet at the McVoy's stable.</p>
<p>Droston and Bartha, coming back into town loaded with game, met the
two and hearing of their adventure, decided to accompany them, no
payment besides the adventure needed. Bartha had everything she
needed, so she told her dad where they were off to and brought her
brace of rabbits for lunch. Droston ran back and dropped off his deer
and gathered his stuff, and then on the way back met his dad Seamus in
the street. His dad wasn't overjoyed at Droston's plans, but couldn't
deny Droston had already finished his day's work. He did tell Droston
that his cousin Brocc (who disliked crowds and therefore avoided the
village during festival), was due back in this morning from the alpine
pastures with his goat herd, but had not been seen yet, and although
it wasn't an immediate worry, somebody had to check up on him
soon. Droston promised to check the high pastures as soon as he was
back from town.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-the-way-to-riverton">
<h5>On the way to Riverton</h5>
<p>Once Droston caught up with the group they headed for town with Eirnin
driving the first wagon, Onchu the second, and Bartha riding a wagon
and Droston ranging alongside, scouting ahead and behind on occasion.</p>
<p>At lunchtime they stopped and cooked Bartha's rabbits and Droston
freely admitted she'd done the right thing bringing them along. After
that they continued along. Eventually they met one of the sheriff's
deputies, Deputy Han, returning from escorting the three thugs to
town. He told them of bad character from town, Roy, who'd killed
somebody over a card game and fled justice and was feared to have
taken to banditry and murder in the area. The friends promised to be
careful and not go looking for trouble, and continued on their way.</p>
<p>They reached the halfway camp that evening, but because they had the
wagons and horses they couldn't use the normal campsite, which was
reached by a narrow rope bridge across the river, and could only draw
the wagons up on the side of a wide area in the road and make camp
behind them. Unfortunately, a starving wolf attacked the horses during
Bartha's watch and before Bartha, Onchu, and Eirnin killed it, Bartha
was severly bitten. (Droston, tired out by his day of walking and
running beside the wagons, only woke up in time to see the aftermath
of the fight.) The wolf didn't seem to be rabid, just starving, but
Bartha needs some serious healing.</p>
<p>And that's where we left them.</p>
