<p>
	In Sev-a-kalam, the party was warned that the southernmost
	reaches of the desert were plagued by bandits, so they
	joined a Auhaami caravan leaving for the next oasis, ten
	days away.  Five days out, they were attacked by maniacs,
	and several people on the caravan, including Tekhadun and
	one other character,<a href="#ftn.idp140214262891592" class="footnote" name="idp140214262891592"><sup class="footnote">[18]</sup></a>
      were captured, and several loaded camels are also
      stolen.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262892536"></a> The caravan master,
      Djavh,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262893400"></a>
      identified the attackers by the eight-pointed
      cross<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262894008"></a> tattooed on one of them as
      Arakanisi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262894600"></a>
      worshipers of the
      demon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262895176"></a>
      Arakan,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262895720"></a> King
      of Chaos, who requires human sacrifices.
      </p>
<p>
	Following the Arakanisi, the party and the warriors from the
	caravan found a series of caves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262896792"></a>
      in the Salt Sea, but alas!  only guards remained:
      the captives had already been taken elsewhere.  Investigating,
      they killed the guards and found several corpses.  In one
      room, apparently formed from the ribs of a huge skeleton, they
      found an altar in front of a statue of beautiful artistry but
      unsettling aspect.  Behind the altar was a huge red vertical
      stone block across the room, in the center of which was a
      vertical whirlpool of flame.  Tracks in the blood and dust of
      the room showed that this was where the Arakanisi and the
      remaining captives had gone.
      </p>
<p>
	The party and several Auhaami crossed through the flames, and
	found themselves in a strange place: the sky was green, the
	grass blue, and a river was red; a miniature sun, moon, and
	stars circled in the sky, and the clouds were white, blue,
	red, brown, and black, and in constant rapid motion.  This was
	Makad-al-Arakan, the world of
	Arakan.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262899752"></a>
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262900296"></a> drank from the red river and
	began to praise<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262900888"></a> Arakan.  (Cormac experienced
	these fits intermittently thereafter for a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> time, until cured
	by<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262902216"></a>
	Mordraug.)
      </p>
<p>
	Following the tracks the party came to an amphitheater, in the
	center of which was a throne.
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262903272"></a> sat
	on the throne and was blasted by lightning, but
	survived.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262903880"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262904552"></a> The party then went back along
	the road and took the other fork, which led them to a
	steep-walled valley containing a heavily guarded prison-like
	structure, which turned out to be where those abducted from
	the caravan were being held.
      </p>
<p><a name="narungsdemon"></a>
	While attempting to bypass the guards along the road to where
	the prisoners were held, Basgoot called upon Narung, his
	cursed magic sword.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262906456"></a> A huge
	demonic<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262907288"></a> figure
	burst forth
	
	from the sword, breaking it into pieces, and grew until his
	head touched the sky.  Basgoot fell into a coma and his body
	became rigid, but he lost some of his more demonic exterior
	characteristics.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262908440"></a>
	He shrank to six foot four and a mere three
	hundred pounds, his skin returned to the color of yellowed
	ivory, and he lost most of the scaled areas on his skin and
	completely lost his talons.  The sky cracked open and
	another huge demonic figure stepped in and the two figures
	began to fight.
      </p>
<p>
	In the confusion and destruction of the ensuing battle
	the party rescued the prisoners, who included many not from
	the caravan.  They all then fled through the rapidly
	disintegrating world back towards the entrance, carrying
	their wounded and unconscious, with Basgoot still clinging
	to the shards of Narung.  Alas, upon reaching the entrance
	they found it closed.  An ancient man, one of the prisoners,
	said that it could only be opened by sacrifice, and offered
	himself:<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262910440"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262910840"></a>
	Gim Torson, one of the few still conscious and capable of
	making decisions, instantly, without the slightest
	hesitation or remorse, accepted the old man's sacrifice and
	chopped his head off, leaving the corpse spouting blood over
	the altar.  The entrance opened and they all passed through
	to the caves in the desert.
      </p>
<p>
	There was not enough water with the caravan for all the
	prisoners, so some were left in the caves while the caravan
	headed for Akhisar, the closest city, to report the actions
	of the Arakanisi and arrange transportation for the other
	prisoners.  Alas, by the time they had returned to the cave
	with transport and Akhisar's warriors, those they had left
	behind had been smashed against the sides and ceilings of
	the caves.  Basgoot remained mind-burnt, and Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262912840"></a>
	still had
	fits frequently.
