<p>
	The party set out to find the treasure Jomanal thought lay
	at the end of the map, and Balour Shaw asked them to keep an
	eye out for a particular book in which he was interested.
      </p>
<p>
	They ran into some slight problems on the way out, because
	Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262776232"></a>
	Bibkins had stolen the purse of an extremely important, not to
	mention malicious and wealthy,
	nobleman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262776872"></a> (committing the infamous and
	almost legendary grand theft
	pickpocket)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262777496"></a> slightly before they were
	scheduled to leave.  He was vigorously sought by the town
	guards, but with the help of the Thieves
	Guild<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262778184"></a>
	(for which he paid dearly) he was smuggled out of town in the
	carcass of a slaughtered animal and joined the rest of the
	party on their trek into the wilderness, although they made
	him travel downwind for several days, until the stench
	subsided.  Following the hints on the map, they finally
	discovered a hidden stronghold at the head of the Tiana River,
	east of Carzala.
      </p>
<p>
	When they tried to enter the stronghold, they were attacked by
	a Water Elemental<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262779592"></a> in a pool beside the entrance.
	Kalo's pony<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262780136"></a> was frightened and fell into the
	pool with Kalo astride it.  Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262781016"></a> attacked the elemental with a
	lightning bolt since that was the party's most effective
	magical offense, and badly damaged the elemental, but it also
	damaged Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262781720"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262782120"></a> and the pony, both now
	involuntarily swimming in the pool.  The blast electrocuted
	the pony, but by some miracle Kalo survived, barely.  After
	searching around some more, they found another entrance, an
	rock-lined shaft down into the ground.
	Boswt<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262783304"></a> slipped
	from the slime-covered hand and footholds while climbing down
	the shaft
	and<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262783928"></a> died.
      </p>
<p>
	The stronghold had been deserted for centuries, during which
	various foul creatures had moved in.  After a few amusing
	incidents with hallucinogenic mushrooms and
	fungi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262785304"></a>
	the party found a large room, in the center of which was a
	large pentacle and inside that a silvery but semi-transparent
	dome.  Under the dome was a beautiful young
	woman,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262786024"></a>
	apparently asleep, and the book which Balour Shaw sought.  The
	dome was impenetrable to all their efforts to open it.
      </p>
<p>
	They returned to Balour Shaw, who accompanied them back to the
	stronghold and opened the dome.  The woman remained entranced.
	On the way back to civilization they were twice attacked, once
	by six men led by an
	assassin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262787304"></a> (who turned out to be carrying a
	strange carved gold coin)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262787912"></a> and once by a
	necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262788488"></a>
	who led six other men.  With the help of Balour Shaw they
	survived.  During one of the attacks
	Basgoot's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262789128"></a>
	sword, Narung,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262789688"></a> began to hum; the person he had
	just struck screamed, then shriveled up and was seemingly
	absorbed by the sword.  Basgoot's eyes turned completely
	black, the blade of the sword glowed blindingly, and then
	Basgoot's eyes closed, he said <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">oh</span>”</span>, and he dropped to the
	ground.  He was unconscious till the party returned to
	civilization.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262791000" class="footnote" name="idp140214262791000"><sup class="footnote">[14]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p>
	When they left Balour Shaw he was researching how to wake the
	woman.  When
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262792696"></a>
	finally awoke, his eyes were normal again.
      </p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up a massive book,
	  which Balour Shaw claimed, six unreadable books, which were
	  sold, a ring, a horn, a rod of lightning, eight vials of
	  healing potion, and two vials of invisibility.  All of the
	  vials were used up rather quickly.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262794616"></a>
