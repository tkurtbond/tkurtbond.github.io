	Rasson recommended the party to
	Tomon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262722088"></a> who was
	looking for a group of adventurers to investigate the rumors
	that something was living in the burial crypts near
	Stonesboro.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262722760"></a>
	The crypts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262723304"></a> turned out to be inhabited by
	various ruffians, sub-humans, and undead, most of which were
	in the service of a
	necromancer,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262723976"></a>
	though the party only figured this out later, near the end of
	the adventure.
      </p>
<p>
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262725000"></a>
      was killed early on.  Barlow Smythe was
      killed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262726248"></a>
    while bravely and selflessly holding off some of the monsters
    in an early retreat, and was replaced by his friend
    Kalo Bibkins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262727576"></a>
  a choice that had a dark and significant impact on the party's
  future.
      </p>
<p>
	During the clearing of the caves, the party met the Ghost of
	Harmon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262729320"></a>
      who asked that one among them take up his sword and clear the
      crypts of Undead; Basgoot accepted, and was
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262730904"></a>
    to kill all the undead in the crypts and their maker.  The
    sword, a magic bastard sword, was named
    Narung.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262732680"></a> Later
    the party met a madman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262733256"></a>
  in the crypts, who offered them a drink from his wineskin.
  Basgoot again accepted, and was drunk for
  days.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262734184"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	Finally the party killed the necromancer after an epic battle
	with all of his remaining undead servants, among whom, alas,
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262735784"></a>
      was now numbered.  Afterwards they freed a group of
      Dwarves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262737048"></a>
    who had been captured by the necromancer and were being forced
    to build tunnels for him.
    
      </p>
<p>
	At some time before, during, or after this adventure, the
	party was summoned to a warehouse where a menacing figure
	warned them that they had crossed him once, and must never
	again do so.  The crates in the warehouse were marked with the
	sign of Suliman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262739624"></a>
      Trade.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262740424" class="footnote" name="idp140214262740424"><sup class="footnote">[12]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up five books and one
	  box of mysterious powder from the from the necromancer's
	  library, one wand of Fire and Brimstone, and a small pouch
	  of red balls that expanded and then exploded.  The pouch has
	  been emptied and the books sold.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262742392"></a>
	</p>

<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>This adventure was gamed sometime in 1985<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262743736"></a>.

<div class="footnotes">

	Is this an emblem, sigil, or icon?  Or merely a name inscribed
	on a box?  (I think this was a symbol burnt into a crate,
	and the party had to research it.)
