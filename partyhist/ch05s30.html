<p>
	  On the morning the party was to leave Seagate,
	  Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263240296"></a> turned up
	  terribly injured (almost dead) at the inn where the party
	  was staying.  The rest of the party healed him and when he
	  recovered he told them he'd been taking care of business
	  when he'd gotten careless and had been captured by the
	  Beggar King's minions.  The party went back to sleep.  When
	  they got up again to leave, they heard the cook telling the
	  innkeeper how ten dead beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263241528"></a> had
	  been found floating out of the sewers so far that morning.
	  The party decided to skip breakfast and leave right away.
	</p>
<p>
	  They reached the South Lending<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263242872"></a> in the Brastor
	  Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263243384"></a> on 25 Silemore 849, where they
	  intended to wait for the
	  mercenaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263243976"></a>
	  and
	  engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263244744"></a>
	  to arrive (except for Remy Gill,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263245560"></a> who was already with them).  As
	  soon as they rode into town, however, many of the town's
	  merchants accosted Jamie Molson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263246200"></a> and demanded the money
	  he owed them.  After much arguing Jamie and the party
	  managed to convince the merchants (helped by Jamie's lack of
	  scaring and his pleasant facial expression) that the Jamie
	  Molson who owed them money was an
	  imposter<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263247224"></a> posing as the real Jamie
	  Molson.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263248040" class="footnote" name="idp140214263248040"><sup class="footnote">[30]</sup></a> After yet more argument the local
	  constable was also convinced, though still suspicious.
	  Unfortunately for Jamie, the
	  innkeeper<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263248936"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263249576"></a> wasn't convinced until
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> he beat Jamie about with a piece
	  of firewood.
	</p>
<p>
	  The first night they were in the South Lending they set a
	  watch and <span class="emphasis"><em>Magelock</em></span>ed their windows,
	  fearing that Jamie's double was after him again.  Alas, they
	  were all cast into an enchanted sleep and Jamie was
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span>ed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263252168"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263252808"></a> away from them.
	  The <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span> woke them up, however, and
	  they immediately began looking for Jamie using
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Seeker</em></span>.  They found that he was about a
	  half a mile away, on the other side of town, and set out for
	  there immediately.
	</p>
<p>
	  Jamie,<a href="#ftn.idp140214263255048" class="footnote" name="idp140214263255048"><sup class="footnote">[31]</sup></a>
	on the other hand, found himself in a dead-end alley facing
	two figures — one his double and the other a demonic
	creature spitting fire.  He attempted to
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span> back to the inn room, but a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport Shield</em></span> prevented it.  He then
	cleverly <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleported</em></span>ed behind the two to
	attack them from behind, but was never-the-less overpowered
	and captured.
	</p>
<p>
	  When the rest of the party arrived they found a number of
	  burned spots and some blood on the ground.  Upon again
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Seek</em></span>ing Jamie they got an
	  image<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263258552"></a> of him lashed over the back of
	  a demonic creature and behind him seated his double, who was
	  laughing manaicly and periodically digging at Jamie with his
	  dagger as they traveled through a hellish landscape.  The
	  landscape seemed familiar to Basgoot from his dreams...
	</p>
<p> The party gave up hope for Jamie and moped around the
	South Lending until the mercenaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263260120"></a> and engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263260936"></a> arrived to
	survey the road.  When the survey mission reached Blackstone
	Chapel<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263261832"></a> they found that several
	important factions in the order opposed the building of the
	road, worried about losing the isolation necessary to a
	religious order and the possibility of conflict with the
	savage hill tribes.  Indeed, some of the Chapel elders went
	so far as to threaten legal proceedings to block the road,
	with some apparent legal justification.  The elders agreed
	to let the road be built after the party surveyed an
	alternate route for the road that did not pass through the
	middle of the Chapel complex and the party was convinced to
	build a wayhouse<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263262952"></a>
	(at a probable cost of 100,000 to 200,000 farthings) for the
	order at the intersection of the new road and the old.
	</p>
<p> Some miles past the Chapel they found the
	ruins<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263264376"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263265064"></a> of what could have been an inn
	or manor house set back a bit from the road.  This could be
	repaired, though only partial walls remain now.  They did
	not find anything unusual about the ruins.  Some days past
	the ruins the party noticed they were being watched by a
	group of tribesmen.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263266168"></a> The
	characters approached the tribesmen, who all had a design
	worked into their clothes with blue-dyed leather.  The
	tribesmen communicated with the party with sign, asking what
	they were doing there.  The party managed to convey
	something of their purpose, and though the tribesmen were
	displeased, they seemed resigned.  They also seemed to
	indicate that hostile tribes lay futher along the party's
	path.
	</p>
<p>
	  Several days later the party was
	  attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263267608"></a> by a
	  couple of hundred tribesmen, who ambushed them in a narrow
	  valley walled with trees and thick underbush.  Even though
	  the party was ambushed, Orm and his troops and the
	  characters easily managed to defeat the tribesmen, having
	  only 3 dead and 3 severly injured, while many tribesmen
	  died.  All of the tribesmen were found to have an irregular
	  eight-pointed figure worked into their clothing with
	  red-dyed leather.
	</p>
<p>
	  Further along in the bending south of the road's path, the
	  party followed a disturbance into the brush one night
	  because they saw Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263269416"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263270088"></a> (who had stayed behind in
	  Seagate to manage the business) running towards them, but
	  before they could reach her she had been pulled into the
	  bushes.  When they reached the area she was gone.
	</p>
<p>
	  Tracks of unusually small humanoids lead away and the party
	  followed them to the foot of a tall crag, where the trail
	  ended.  Gim <span class="emphasis"><em>Walked on Air</em></span> to the top of the
	  crag, but saw only the ruins of a
	  castle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263272104"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263272792"></a>  Remy and Shay investigated
	  inside the rock of the crag, but found nothing.  After much
	  searching about, Derenedeth cast <span class="emphasis"><em>Flight</em></span>
	  on four of the party and they carried the other party
	  members to the top of the crag, where they saw the castle
	  ruins, but this time there was an intact tower!  Gim
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Bird Control</em></span>ed the giant owls nesting
	  on the top of the tower away, and the party landed and
	  entered the tower.
	</p>
<p>
	  The tower was filled with many strange things, including
	  invisible servants, golem
	  guardians,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263275336"></a>
	  macabre decorations, and all the modern
	  conveniences.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263275928"></a> In a room floored by a
	  huge five-pointed star in a circle the party was attacked by
	  five golems after a fireball dropped out of the ceiling and
	  exploded in the middle of the room.  In the throne room they
	  were attacked by 20 demons while another demon carried Tesla
	  down the stairs to the basement.  The surviving demons
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Blink</em></span>ed out down the stairs when the
	  party had slaughtered most of them, and the corpses revealed
	  that they had actually been short humanoids.  The party
	  recognized them as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Little People</span>”</span> of
	  BAMF's report.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263277848"></a>
	</p>
<p>
	  When they tried to follow they ended up on an endless stair
	  trap<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263278856"></a>
	  that finally led them to the roof where they now found an
	  observatory and an
	  orrery,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263279480"></a>
	  which when pushed caused the stars to whirl violently,
	  making all of the party terribly ill.  Going back down to
	  the basement they found it completely filled with what they
	  thought was water but what was actually a Sucking Reek that
	  turned Gim into a <span class="emphasis"><em>Body of Air</em></span>, sucked
	  him in and nearly dissolved him.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263280728"></a> After returning to
	  the throne room for much discussion, they tried the basement
	  again and this time it was dry-floored and contained a
	  steeply inclined tunnel that lead down through the crag.
	</p>
<p>
	  At the bottom of the crag they found an arid
	  plane<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263282200"></a> of dust-filled winds and
	  sand and gravel and baked clay, littered with various body
	  parts.  Over them a huge blood-red sun visibly rose in the
	  west, and all around were crags and huge piles of boulders.
	  They heard distant screams and Gim remembered legends of
	  such an infernal place.  They followed some tracks to a
	  crack in the bottom of another crag, which lead into a
	  series of passageways resembling nothing so much as the
	  digestive system of some huge subterranean
	  beast.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263283256"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263283656"></a> Disoriented by the foul air and
	  the nature of the passageways they stumbled through a
	  central chamber with six exits and out another tunnel.
	</p>
<p>
	  This tunnel eventually turned to stone and led to a set of
	  double doors.  When they opened the doors they were looking
	  upon a huge semi-spherical room with a number of statues, a
	  five-pointed star in a circle containing a dismembered body,
	  a blood-covered figure rising from the floor, and
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Jamie</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263285336"></a> tied to one of the statues.
	  They recognized the figure as the
	  mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263286216"></a> who
	  threatened them in Suliman
	  Trade's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263286792"></a> warehouse during the Crypts of
	  Stonesboro adventure, and <span class="emphasis"><em>he</em></span> recognized
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>them!</em></span> The party immediately began a
	  desperate attack to cover Basgoot's attempt to rescue Jamie.
	  After <span class="emphasis"><em>Haste</em></span>ing himself, Basgoot ran out
	  and slashed Jamie free from the statue with Narung, slicing
	  him slightly in the process, then ran back to the double
	  doors.  While this was going on the others were trying to
	  cast spells (which all fizzled out), keep open the slowly
	  closing double doors, and endure the attacks of fire and ice
	  triggered by the mage.  They managed to keep the doors open
	  until Basgoot had dragged Jamie through (Cormac
	  losing<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263289208"></a> the last joint of the
	  little finger on his right hand as the doors closed) and
	  then fled back up the passage under a hail of ice-daggers
	  and fireballs.
	</p>
<p>
	  Fleeing back through the slimy tunnels, they again stumbled through
	  the central chamber and took another tunnel.  This one eventually
	  turned to packed earth, which started collapsing about them as they
	  squirmed through.  Several of the party got stuck in the collapsing
	  tunnel, but the others managed to pull them out, into the bottom of a
	  pit, above which was a beautiful blue sky.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263291016" class="footnote" name="idp140214263291016"><sup class="footnote">[32]</sup></a>

<a name="idp140214263293688"></a>5.30.2. Roadtrip! Part 2: Nomads, Orcs, Little People, and Orcs Again</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
	  The session began with the characters at the bottom of a
	  pit, staring at a wonderful blue sky above them.  Upon
	  investigating, they found that the pit was surrounded by
	  tall poles surmounted by skulls and short, painted wands
	  tasselled with feather or furs.  Off in the distance is what
	  appears to be a tribal encampment of Horse
	  nomads.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263295336"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263295736"></a> The tunnel they came through is
	  only partially collapsed, so the characters decided to dig
	  back through, after spending some time resting and healing
	  themselves.
	</p>
<p>
	  They began to dig, but while they are digging they hear
	  something taunting them and cursing them; when they look up,
	  on the edge of pit is a horrible creature: a spider with a
	  3-yard leg-span and a human torso attached to the front of
	  its cephalothorax!<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263297096"></a> Needless to say, there's a lot
	  of cursing going on as part of the party stands the monster
	  off while the rest finish the digging.  They manage to flee
	  back through the tunnel without anyone being killed, though
	  some were bit.
	</p>
<p>
	  The characters travelled back through the tunnels (or bowels
	  as the case may be), through the central chamber, and out
	  through another tunnel.  This one eventually turned into a
	  stone tunnel that narrowed down to an 3 foot tall, 18 inch
	  wide crack, which opened into a rough-hewn corridor that
	  lead off to the right and left.  Deep, gravelly voices could
	  be heard coming from both directions, but no-one could hear
	  enough to determine what they were.  Foolhardy and brave,
	  the characters decided to sneak down the corridor to the
	  right, which lead them to a chamber full of
	  Orcs.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263298904"></a> Against the back wall of
	  the chamber was a throne of huge bones and tusks, upon which
	  sat a huge orc holding a large sceptre or mace.  All of the
	  Orcs where busily employed devouring their meal; it's
	  probably best not to inquire what was on the menu.  The
	  sounds of bones cracking under the pressure of orcish molars
	  covered whatever sounds the characters may have made during
	  their approach, and they decided that discretion was the
	  better part of valour and retreated back down the crack and
	  into the slimy, odoriferous tunnels.
	</p>
<p>
	  Again the characters travelled back through the passageways,
	  again through the central chamber, and again out through yet
	  another exit.  <span class="emphasis"><em>This</em></span> time they came out
	  into the night in a niche on the side of a hill, a flat
	  place with steep sides and a short cliff on the back, where
	  the tunnel entrance was.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263301144"></a> The niche overlooked a desolate
	  heath, and in the distance the characters saw a faint glow,
	  and some of them occasionally heard chanting.  They were
	  attacked by two of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Little People</span>”</span>, but soon defeated
	  them.  Looking around a bit they found some stained leather
	  bindings that looked like foot-wrappings and still had
	  traces of the slime from the tunnels.
	</p>
<p>
	  Since the pressence of the Little People seemed to indicate
	  a likelyhood of finding
	  Tesla,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263303224"></a> and no
	  other interesting features presented themselves, the
	  characters set off north towards the glow and the chanting.
	  Out on the heath the characters came to a barrow mound, and
	  beyond the barrow mound was a ring of standing stones, and
	  in the center of that was a three-legged dolmen.  There were
	  three fires in front of the dolmen, around which danced many
	  of the Little People, and beside one of them was a wizened
	  oldster bedecked with feathers and furs and paint,
	  sharpening a cleaver.  Atop the dolmen were four warriors,
	  and what looked suspicously like a bound human.
	</p>
<p>
	  Attacking the Little People.  Rescuing
	  Tesla,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263304824"></a> with lots of invisibility and
	  flying.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263305688" class="footnote" name="idp140214263305688"><sup class="footnote">[33]</sup></a> Because of his great strength, Basgoot
	  was probably the one who grabbed Tesla, although there was
	  probably someone who also helped with Tesla.  Shay Uvall
	  probably attacked the shaman and took his cleaver, and there
	  may have been others attacking the group of Little People.
	  In general, lots of hacking and slashing went on.
	</p>
<p>
	  Not surprisingly, the Little People were not pleased by this
	  assault on their religious rites, and pursued the characters
	  with fury, cries of rage, and sharp objects.  Luckily, the
	  characters were faster.  Not to mention largely invisible.
	  Still, it was a close race back to the tunnel
	  entrance.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263307720" class="footnote" name="idp140214263307720"><sup class="footnote">[34]</sup></a>
	</p>
<p>
	  The characters fled back through the Belly of the
	  Beast,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263308872"></a> for such it now seemed certain
	  it was, for as they scuttled through the depth of the slime
	  increased, jets of slime shot out of orifices in the walls,
	  the tunnels shook and quaked and quivered, seemingly in
	  agony, and a terrible deep <span class="emphasis"><em>beat</em></span>
	  reverberated throughout the the tunnels.  Things Were
	  Obviously Not Well.  Luckily, this time as they stumbled
	  through the central chamber they chose the exit that lead
	  out to the infernal desert, above which rose the castle on
	  its crag.
	</p>
<p>
	  Finally they reached the crag and tiredly climbed up the
	  tunnel into the castle dungeon.  After some difficulty
	  getting out of the castle due to uncertainty of the stairs
	  leading one to where one expected to go (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Didn't we just do
	  this?</span>”</span>) they managed to escape and returned to the the camp
	  with their mercenary<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263311448"></a> soldiers, and found out that they had
	  only been gone only <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> day.  They
	  continued with the survey of the road.  When they got to the
	  cliff, they had to leave their horses behind, but they
	  continued with their survey, heading down out of the
	  mountains towards the Vale of Morin.
	</p>
<p>
	  Jamie, troubled by the pains of his wounds and the even
	  greater pains of worries about what his double was up too,
	  was wandering about in the night and stumbled upon an badly
	  wounded orc standing over the newly killed body of another
	  orc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263313608"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263314296"></a> The remaining
	  orc attacked Jamie, but because of his wounds was easily
	  dispatched.  The Orcs had two
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Evil</em></span>-looking magic items: a Mace in the
	  form of a metal Skull and an Axe fancifully engraved with
	  the visage of a hideous demon.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263315768" class="footnote" name="idp140214263315768"><sup class="footnote">[35]</sup></a>
	</p>
<p>
	  The next day the outriders reported a large part of Orcs
	  very near coming quickly toward the party.  Orm quickly
	  commanded the party up onto flat spot above a extremely
	  rugged and steep hillside to await the Orcs.  About a
	  hundred orcs approached, and send out a herald to parley.
	  He demanded the return of the of their two sacred relics.
	  During the parley, another group of about a hundred orcs
	  appeared, to the anger of the first group, and they also
	  sent a herald to demand the return of
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> sacred relics.  After some
	  stalling by the party, the two groups of orcs both
	  attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263317928"></a> the party, co-operating against a
	  common enemy, though obviously enemies themselves.  The
	  party was outnumbered by more than two-to-one, and these
	  Orcs were clearly better armed and armored than the
	  tribesmen had been.  Cleverly, the characters thought to
	  abduct<a href="#ftn.idp140214263318760" class="footnote" name="idp140214263318760"><sup class="footnote">[36]</sup></a> and neutralize
	  the Orc mages and leaders, which helped, and their defensive
	  location helped, but even so it was difficult battle.  The
	  party was successful, though, with the orcs fleeing the
	  battle at the end, and all the characters surviving.
