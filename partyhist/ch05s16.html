<p>
	The party left for the nearest city of any size, Marv
	Dashlam,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262936680"></a>
	hoping to be cured.  There they visited the Mages'
	Guild,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262937272"></a> but the cost of a cure was beyond
	their means.  The next morning they were visited by old,
	shabbily dressed man who informed them that if they wished
	freed of their curse they could visit a particular house that
	evening.  During the day they spoke with the merchants of the
	city to fulfill their geas, but the merchants were not
	interested in trade along such a risky route as through the
	Gatar Shey.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262938488"></a> The merchants seemed very
	complacent and unaggressive.
      </p>
<p>
	That night they visited the house, where a mysterious
	man<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262939528"></a> (who told them to call him
	Albad, though this was obviously not his real
	name)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262940168"></a> of
	obvious authority offered to have them cured if they would
	kidnap a certain holy man named
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262940808"></a> and take
	him back with them to their homeland, under no circumstances
	allowing him to come to harm.  Albad said they had until the
	next evening to consider.  The next day they were approached
	by a priest of the local religion, who spoke of an evil
	heretic, a fiend in human form, and asked them to rid the city
	of this menace.  They did not accept, and the priest left
	angrily, hoping the gods would send them their reward.
      </p>
<p>
	That night they returned to the house and accepted the
	mysterious man's offer; he had them cured by a master mage,
	then <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span> to kidnap the holy man.  They
	were joined the next day by
	Jubad,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262942776"></a> who
	somehow knew of their errand
	
	and offered to help them find Hajj.  With his help they did
	find Hajj, who was hidden in the magic garden of one of his
	followers, but when they went to abduct Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262943880"></a>, Jubad attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262944712"></a>
	them and attempted to kill Hajj.  Hajj was injured, but they
	managed to save him.  Jubad escaped, and soon the city was
	up in arms, looking for the villains who had attacked their
	holy man, and perhaps killed him in the process.
      </p>
<p>
	The priests, of course, still wanted Hajj dead.
      </p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  Albad gave the characters some magic items to assist them
	  with their task and to pay them for doing it.  They received
	  a knobed cane three feet long that was invested with
	  Enchanted Sleep, a chain one-and-a-half feet long invested
	  with Binding, and Winther, Basgoot, Cormac, Jamie, and Gim
	  received scrolls, each with two spells.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262947608"></a>
