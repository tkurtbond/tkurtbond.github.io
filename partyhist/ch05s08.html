<p>
	The party took the plains route to the South, but were forced
	into the ominous Thornwood Forest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262818488"></a> by the Horse
	Nomads.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262819064"></a>
	In the forest they stumbled upon a clearing, in which there
	were several statues and a tiny hut.  The wizened old woman
	who lived in the hut introduced herself as Mother
	Thistle<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262819784"></a> (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Mother Thistle Knows!</span>”</span>), and
	invited them inside.  Surprisingly enough they all fit.
      </p>
<p>
	Once they were inside she spoke obscurely of three mages who
	had touched the party: The Mage, The Necromancer, and Balour
	Shaw, saying that they had angered the first two twice
	each.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262821384"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262821784"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262822200"></a> She then went on to say that the
	Hand of the Otherworld had touched all of the party, and had
	possessed one of them.  She warned that the dead could help
	them, but could also destroy, and that the desert's most
	powerful dangers were also the least obvious.
      </p>
<p>
	When they left her hut the next day, they found they were on
	the southern edge of the forest, though there was no way they
	could have traveled that far before finding the hut.
      </p>
<p><a name="ghostsKorsepolis"></a>
	South of the Forest was the Vale of
	Morin,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262824440"></a>
	once the site of fierce battles against the Horse Nomads.
	During their first day in the Vale the party saw the Horse
	Nomads who had chased them earlier, but the nomads, though
	they obviously saw the party, did not enter the Vale.  Later,
	the party was accosted by a group of
	Ghosts,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262825256"></a> who asked about the state of their
	city, Korsepolis.  Upon learning that
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262825896"></a>
	had been in ruins for centuries, the Ghosts traded the party a
	promise of safe passage across the Vale in return for the
	party's oath to reestablish trade with the Kingdoms of the
	Five Sisters and resettle
	Korsepolis.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262826648"></a> Since the former they were
	already <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span> to do and the later was a
	matter for the future, they agreed, as the best bargain in the
	situation.  The Ghosts also told the party that Korsepolis
	
	had the best roads
	through the mountains to the desert, and so would be the
	easiest route to the desert.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262828328" class="footnote" name="idp140214262828328"><sup class="footnote">[16]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262829448"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	The party found Korsepolis in the mouth of a valley that led
	up into the mountains.  They snuck through the city after
	dark, almost blundered into a
	war<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262830520"></a> between orcs and hobgoblins,
	and then followed the road out of Korsepolis into the
	mountains.  The road crossed the mountains and ended at a
	tower overlooking a one thousand foot drop to the desert: this
	was the Mountain Wall from which these mountains took their
	name.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262831368"></a>
