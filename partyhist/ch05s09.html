	They were invited into the tower by a elderly, pleasant
	seeming if somewhat quirky Fire Giant,
	Slehad<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262834824"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262835224"></a>
	He told them about the tower, and the track that descended to
	the desert, and mentioned that he left Carzala three hundred
	years ago, soon after it was settled by humans.  However,
	during the night he attacked the party, and it was only with
	the greatest of struggles that they defeated him.  They
	explored the tower and found that his larder was stocked with
	human and elvish corpses.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262836152"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262836824"></a>
      </p>
<p> 
	In the tower they also found a curious clay
	ball,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262838072"></a> a
	chest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262838616"></a> and a small box.  The small box
	proved to contain a moderate quantity of an unknown
	drug.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262839256"></a>
	Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262839800"></a>
	broke the ball, releasing a strange shadow-like
	creature,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262840392"></a> and found that the ball also
	enclosed a key.  When Jamie used the key to open the chest the
	key bit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262841048"></a>
	him.  Later, Jamie ingested some of the drug from the box and
	experienced strange hallucinations and euphoria.
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262841704"></a> summoned the Giant's spirit
	back to explain the strange contents of the chest, but the
	Giant's answers were obscure at best, and not of much use.

<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up a scroll with
	  three spells inscribed upon it, broke open one small clay
	  ball which turned out to have a biting key and a shadow
	  creature in it, and ten other clay balls, one of which was
	  later broken when warring against the Queen of the
	  Thri-Kreen and released another shadow creature.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262843800"></a>
