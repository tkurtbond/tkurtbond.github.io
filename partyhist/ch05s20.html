<p>
	Upon reaching Seagate they were ushered into the
	Count's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263003992"></a> presence, where he congratulated
	them, and restored to them their property which had been
	seized illegally by the court when they were
	exiled.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263004696"></a> He also explained that there
	had been many irregular legal aspects to their arrest, trial,
	and sentencing, and that he had reversed their sentences for
	that reason.
      </p>
<p>
	He rewarded them for their journey by giving each of them
	dwarven armor,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263006152"></a> and arranged a meeting of the
	major merchants<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263006728"></a> to hear about the journey and
	the prospects for trade.  At the meeting they were heckled by
	<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263007368"></a>, 
	whose low opinion of them found ready favor with
	some disgruntled members of the court, though not with the
	Count.  During the meeting a mysterious explosion in Arn's
	Ferry<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263008088"></a> was
	mentioned; it had destroyed the ancient Giant's tower where
	Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263008696"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263009096"></a> lived.
	(Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263010040"></a> was
	dismayed: of what use was his apprenticeship now?)  After the
	meeting Wesved sent men to kill the party members, but the
	party dispatched the assassins with ease, and Wesved's head<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263010760"></a>
	ended on a pole when the Count<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263011608"></a> investigated his actions.
      </p>
<p>
	The party found that it had returned after four years to a
	country in disorder: bandits and outlaws were
	everywhere,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263012712"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263013112"></a>
	travel had become difficult,
	pirates<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263013688"></a> were
	ruining trade with the North, smuggling had increased
	dramatically,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263014296"></a>
	drug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263014840"></a> use had
	run rampant (and not just in the cities, causing many to worry
	that the work-force of Carzala would be ruined), people were
	disappearing from cities and farms, and a group of Barons,
	including the Baron of Seagate,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263015608"></a> opposed the Count in everything
	he did.  No one was able to understand why the country had
	deteriorated so rapidly.  How had things come to this?  Had
	the gods looked on Carzala with disfavor?  Was the whole land
	cursed?
