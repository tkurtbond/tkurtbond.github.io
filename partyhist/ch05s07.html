	Alas, Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262798952"></a>
	brought his past crashing down upon himself 
	<span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
	the rest of the party.
	Upon returning to Seagate, Kalo sent a taunting letter to
	the nobleman whom he had pickpocketed.  Unfortunately for
	Kalo, the nobleman had no sense of humor, and hired a bounty
	hunter<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262800152"></a>
	
	to track Kalo down.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262801208"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262801608"></a> The bounty hunter did, and
	delivered Kalo to the local dungeon and an eagerly awaiting
	torturer.
      </p>
<p>
	Under torture,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262802824"></a> Kalo incriminated the
	party<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262803656"></a> in his earlier escape from
	Seagate, and the party was arrested by order of Amur
	Gibbetsmaster.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262804568"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262804984"></a> The party was forced to watch
	Kalo's beheading, a singularly botched exhibition, since the
	executioner<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262805896"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262806296"></a> was blind drunk.  It took
	him six blows to kill Kalo,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262807160"></a> and even then Kalo's head was not
	completely severed from his body.  The surviving party members
	were themselves offered a choice: death, or a
	geas<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262808120"></a> to scout out a caravan trail
	across the southern desert to the semi-mythical kingdoms of
	the Five Sisters.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262808776" class="footnote" name="idp140214262808776"><sup class="footnote">[15]</sup></a>
	They choose the geas, of course.
      </p>
<p>
	Two other prisoners, Jamie Molson and Tekhadun, were also sent
	south with them.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262811864"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262812536"></a> Jamie was betrayed to the Seagate
	city guards by a rival thief,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262813416"></a> and Tekhadun had
	killed a nobleman's son in a tavern brawl.  (Incidentally, the
	ruler of Carzala was out of the
	country<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262814344"></a> during this whole affair, and
	the punishment was the idea of Amur Gibbetsmaster, the hanging
	judge of Seagate.)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262815016"></a>
