	After the abduction of Amur Gibbetsmaster<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263056664"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263057080"></a>
	and its aftermath,
	the party returned to the cove to claim the ships, which the
	Count had awarded them.  The Count sent along a crew for
	each ship and a few marines to help and to make sure that all
	the deadly drugs were destroyed (and to make sure he got his
	eight percent of the treasure).  When the party started
	taking goods out of the caves they were attacked by a
	Phantasm in each cave.  Later they were attacked by huge
	spiders,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263058344"></a>
	which captured several of the crew and Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263058920"></a>
	and
	Winther.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263059480" class="footnote" name="idp140214263059480"><sup class="footnote">[23]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263060616"></a>
	The spiders retreated into
	tunnels<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263061192"></a> hidden beyond false walls at the
	ends of the smugglers' caves and the party followed, leaving
	the majority of the marines and crew to continue loading the
	ships.
      </p>
<p> 
	These tunnels led to a huge maze of crooked tunnels, infested
	by spiders and other strange creatures.  The party rescued
	some of the captured marines and sailors, along with two
	halflings<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263062520"></a> and a massive, grey, otherworldly
	being (Evan),<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263063144"></a>
	but the others had been taken to a huge circular room of
	worship.  This room was dominated by ever changing views of
	other places on the walls, an altar where the spiders where
	sacrificing their captives, and a gigantic demonic spider
	whose limbs spanned the room.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263063944"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263064360"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263064760"></a> Most of the prisoners were
	freed in the ensuing battle, but the walls of the room kept
	fading in and out, and one of the marines stumbled into one of
	the scenes on the wall and vanished.  Ominously, the altar was
	marked with an eight-pointed
	star.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263065560"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up 10 vials
	  containing healing potions, three one-inch diameter bronze
	  balls invested with 
	  
	  Fireball, Imploding Fireball, and Invisibility, five quart
	  jars of very powerful acid, three books on alchemy,
	  
	  a book on magic experimental techniques procedures (which
	  also contained a parchment with an incomplete spell), a
	  spell book, and three glass balls filled with an opaque
	  
	  mixture.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263068616"></a>
