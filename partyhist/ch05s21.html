<p>
	One evening not long after their return to Seagate, the party
	was relaxing in their house<a href="#ftn.idp140214263019896" class="footnote" name="idp140214263019896"><sup class="footnote">[21]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263020312"></a>
	when one of them heard a knocking 
	on the shutter of his window.  Upon opening the window, he
	found
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263020968"></a>
	hanging from the roof.  He swung in and said that it was best
	that he was not seen with the party.  When the whole group had
	gathered, he asked them if they were interested in revenge
	against Amur Gibbetsmaster,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263021992"></a>
	the judge who forced them into the journey to the south.  They
	were, and agreed to meet
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263022648"></a>
	later in an abandoned warehouse.  He then left by the same
	route he entered.
      </p>
<p><a name="returningfromthedead"></a>
	At the meeting, he showed the characters papers that proved
	that the judge wanted to send a group south for his own
	purposes, and chose the party because they were convenient.
	Other papers indicated that Gibbetsmaster was involved with
	smuggling and perhaps the drug
	shipments<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263024440"></a>
	that were so devastating the cities.  Unfortunately, the
	papers were not legal proof of Gibbetsmaster's involvement,
	but they did mention a possible landing of smuggling ships,
	and the party decided to investigate that in hopes of finding
	out more.  Amazingly,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Kalo Bibkins</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263026024"></a>
	also showed up at this meeting and behaved in a very eccentric
	manner.  He offered no reason for his continued existence, and
	no one felt brave enough to ask.
      </p>
<p>
	Arriving at the cove where the landing was scheduled the party
	found that the ships had already arrived, and were about to be
	unloaded.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263027528"></a>
      Using stealth, distractions, and the help of the unnerving Kalo
      Bibkins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263028408"></a>
    they killed the lookouts and wiped out most of the smugglers
    before the smugglers realized what was happening.  During the
    fight a large crate was dropped on
    Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263029384"></a>
  from a cave fifty feet up a cliff, breaking most of the bones
  in her body.  One of the ships turned out to be a
  pirate<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263030696"></a>
and the other turned out to be owned directly by Amur
Gibbetsmaster;<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263031480"></a>
both were packed full of
drugs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263032712"></a>
to be smuggled into the country and had recently been fitted
with slave chains.  The ships carried papers incriminating
Gibbetsmaster in slave trading,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263033656"></a>
drug running, and smuggling valuable goods out of the country.
Three hidden caves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263034536"></a>
on the cliff side turned out to be full of smuggled goods.
      </p>
<p>
	Following leads from the few surviving smugglers, the party
	found the two hundred slaves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263036280"></a> Gibbetsmaster intended to
	ship out this trip, guarded by twenty-five ruffians.  The
	party freed the slaves and returned to Seagate to inform the
	Count of Gibbetsmaster's treachery, having left the uncanny
	Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263037048"></a> to
	guard the ships.  On the way they were attacked by a group of
	ruffians roused by a guard who had escaped the slave coffle,
	but the party survived the attack and wiped out the ruffians,
	leaving no one to warn Gibbetsmaster.
