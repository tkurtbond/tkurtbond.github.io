      Early in my years at college<a href="#ftn.idp140274094613224" class="footnote" name="idp140274094613224"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
      I ran a short <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094614120"></a>
      campaign using <span class="orgname">SPI</span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094614888"></a>'s <em class="citetitle">The Enchanted Wood</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094615656"></a> adventure.
      Unfortunately, I don't have any notes on that campaign, other
      than the ones I wrote in the adventure booklet itself, but I do
      remember that the players were my older brother Paul, his
      girlfriend (at the time, and now wife) Connie, and my friends
      Howard, Larry, and I think Matt.  It went well and everybody
      seemed to have a good time.  After it was over I eventually
      decided to run another campaign using <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094616888"></a> with a new
      set of characters.  It ran for a much longer time, and I kept
      somewhat better notes this time, so I've been able to
      reconstruct much of its history.

	died at the Crypts of Stonesboro, heroically holding off the

	(Larry Wilson's character, transformed.)
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094650472"></a>
	started with a troubled past and has accumulated many more
	problems as time went by, but the greatest of his afflictions
	is his on-again-off-again transformation from human to demonic
	changeling by the powerful demon (see <a class="xref" href="#narungsdemon">Narung's Demon</a> and <a class="xref" href="#narungreforged">Narung Reforged</a>)
	imprisoned inside Narung, the powerful magical sword he
	accepted from a ghost.  The demon has apparently learned how
	to stay on the material plane even when <span class="magic">Banished</span> or killed, and so must be
	imprisoned for all time.  Basgoot is also intermittently
	plagued by drunkenness, first brought on by drinking from the
	wineskin of an old man the party met in the same crypts they
	found Narung.  This old man has occasionally appeared
	elsewhere to confuse the party and help Basgoot, including in
	the South.

	(Howard Hill's first character, deceased.)
	Boswt<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094654984"></a> died at

	(Vicky Staubly's character, deceased.)
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094657160"></a> was known
	for his anachronistic exclamation `Hot Tub!' and for his
	shades.  He died at the Crypts of Stonesboro and, sadly,
	reappeared later as a zombie re-animated by the necromancer of
	the crypts and fought against his former friends, who killed
	him.

	(Steve Scott's character.)  Cormac
	Tricerius<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094659528"></a> died in an ambush on the way
	to Blackstone Chapel and died again later in its defense, but
	was resurrected each time by the grateful clerics' deity.  In
	Makad-al-Arakan he drank of the Waters of Arakan's Delight,
	acquiring thereby a link to and weakness for Arakan which long
	troubled him and was cured only by
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094660408"></a>,
	the Necromancer of Wolf River.

	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094662536"></a>
	escaped the round-up of the party that ended in their exile,
	and while the rest of the party vacationed in the south he
	occupied himself with shadowy endeavors in Carzala's
	underworld.  When they returned he provided them with the
	information they needed to revenge themselves on the Judge who
	exiled them, information that enriched them at the same time
	and eventually resulted in their being rewarded with a barony.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094663496"></a>

	(Alan Bond's character.)  Gim Torson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094665832"></a> is an elf who has lived too long
	among humans.  He died in the defense of Blackstone Chapel,
	but was resurrected by the grateful clerics' deity.
	Originally one of the consciences of the party, he has
	latterly become unhesitating and ruthless (just ask the old
	man on the altar in Makad-al-Arakan).  He lost a leg to a
	demon's hunger and anger and gained the nickname
	<span class="personname"><span class="othername">Gimp</span></span>, but
	regained his leg by the magic of
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094667336"></a> the
	necromancer.  Neither he nor Jamie nor Shay nor Basgoot nor
	Cormac can remember what they did for a month to repay the
	necromancer for re-attaching Gim's leg and healing Balour
	Shaw, but they fear the worst.  (After all, he was a

	(Ray Smith's third character.)  Betrayed to the authorities by
	a rival, Jamie Molson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094670104"></a> joined the party when they were
	exiled to the south.  He died while in the south, at the Inn
	of the Prophet's End during an attack by assassins.  Luckily
	his miserly companions found enough money on his person for a
	resurrection.  If it weren't for his tight grasp,
	Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094670920"></a> would
	have ended up with

	Mordraug's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094672072"></a>
	Lair, and he was lucky to get the five fingers thus cut off

	(Ray Smith's second character.)  Kalo
	Bibkins<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094674344"></a>
	was a rash but entertaining halfling who caused the party's
	exile to the south and in the process was messily executed for
	theft.  He still troubles the party's sleeping hours (and
	occasionally their waking ones), unable to rest peacefully in

	foolish, suicidal, and given to desecration of just about
	anything, usually by strewing entrails.
      </p><p><a name="shay-uvall"></a><b>Shay Uvall. </b>
	(Howard Hill's third character.)  From south of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094679528"></a>,
	Shay Uvall is also valiant, foolish, given to desecration of
	just about anything, usually by strewing entrails; whether he's
	suicidal or not isn't yet known.  He has travelled widely in
	the South as both a merchant and a mercenary.
      </p><p><a name="tesla-ramana"></a><b>Tesla Ramana. </b>
	(Karen Elliott's character.)  Tesla
	Ramana<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094681864"></a>
	left adventuring after being crippled by a crate of contraband
	dropped on her during the attack on Smugglers Cove, but has
	applied herself to the equally competitive (if usually less
	violent) world of trade and looks after many of the party's
	day to day business operations.  Her disfiguring injuries have
	started her on a program of surgical and magical alterations
	that seem to be leading beyond mere repair.
      </p><p><a name="winther"></a><b>Winther. </b>
	(Matt Elliott's character.)
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094684376"></a> was
	often called the `Band-Aid' by the other members of the party
	because of his healing skills, and fond of debate and reasoned
	discussion, he is the party's bastion of morality in an
	uncertain world.  He feels a sense of duty to better the
	world, and his companions, but suffers occasional dark fits of
	cynicism.  Winther also drank from the wine-sack of that
	wandering madman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094685304"></a> when he appeared to them in the
	South, and thus sometimes seeks refuge in the blood of the
	vine.
      </p><p><a name="spear-fodder"></a><b>Spear Fodder. </b>
	(Played by various drop-ins.)  These various visitors
	typically did not survive long.  Such is life, and death.

      the name of the mysterious man in Marv
      Dashlam<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094691048"></a>who
      hired them to abduct Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094691624"></a>.
      </p><p><a name="amur-gibbetsmaster"></a><b>Amur Gibbetsmaster. </b>
	Amur Gibbetsmaster,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094693720"></a> the hanging judge of Seagate, exiled the
	party with a geas to explore the South to further his own

	party was instrumental in his own downfall and eventual hanging.
      </p><p><a name="balour-shaw"></a><b>Balour Shaw. </b>
	(Crazed no longer, just missing.)  A mysterious mage, sometime
	mentor of Gim Torson and once insane and in the custody of the
	party, Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094696136"></a> was cured by
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094696696"></a> the
	necromancer and has since disappeared, telling the party
	they're responsible for Carzala's survival now — he has
	better things to do.
      </p><p><a name="beggar-king"></a><b>Beggar King. </b>
	This evil being<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094699032"></a>lives in the sewers and tunnels
	below Seagate, and controls all of the beggars who live in and
	around Seagate.  He is an occasional enemy of the party
	because of their intrusions into his domain.
      </p><p><b>Brandon Marec. </b>
	Brandon Marec<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094700952"></a> is
	the captain of the Seagate city guards, a vicious bully, and a
	follower of Tathlam Dargan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094701576"></a>, the Baron of Seagate.  Brandon
	has a special place in his heart for the party, and it's not
	somewhere anyone would want to visit.
      </p><p><b>Camlost. </b>
	Captain of one of the party's ships,
	Camlost<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094703464"></a> is a
	very severe and ascetic human, tall, dark, and dour.  While
	not well liked by his men, they have tremendous respect for
	his skill and his courage.  Not much is known about his
	history before he started working the trade routes from
	Carzala to the North ten years ago.
      </p><p><b>Cleirach. </b>
	(Pronounced <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cleary</span>”</span>.)  The main engineer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094705896"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094706824"></a>
	hired by the
	party to build the road, Cleirach is a small man, very quick
	physically and mentally both.  He is full of strong
	opinions.  He learned his trade in the North, in the Broken
	Lands<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094707560"></a>, and in the Confederacy, where he also worked on
	civilian projects.
      </p><p><b>Corvious Dark-blade. </b>
	A skilled weapons-master who runs a private weapons training
	establishment in Seagate, Corvious
	Darkblade<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094709720"></a> was Barlow Smythe's first
	contact in Carzala.  His cognomen comes from the strange blade
	of dark metal that he carries.  Corvious has an enviable
	reputation as someone <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to anger, and
	various rumors abound that the fencing academy he runs is
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> his real business.
      </p><p><b>Daffyd ap Hugh. </b>
	Captain of the Count's courier vessel, the <span class="name">Seaswift</span>, Daffyd ap
	Hugh<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094713240"></a>
	is the intelligent young man who escorted the characters back
	to Smugglers' Cove when they returned to retrieve their ships.
      </p><p><b>Delath Lorven. </b>
	The Count of Seagate.
      </p><p><b>Dohraoul. </b>
	Dohraoul<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094716296"></a> is
	the Knight of Theris<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094716856"></a> who escorted the party off the
	soil of Carzala via Chapel Crossing<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094717480"></a> at the border of the Brastor
	Holding and the Sea of Grass.  He was a grim man who behaved
	politely to the party members because, as he explained upon
	first meeting them, he thought they had been dishonorably
	treated — they should have been allowed to die with
	their honor and dignity intact.  He was also the first to
	welcome the party back to civilization and Carzala when they
	crossed back into the Brastor Holding at Chapel Crossing on
	their return journey.
      </p><p><b>Dhairrhuwyth. </b>
	A wizard who lived in Seagate and was friends with Balour Shaw.
	Helped the party disrupt the Arkanian's attempt to call up
	Arakan at Finn's Waste.
      </p><p><b>Dulinn Wiell. </b>
	Dulinn Wiell<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094721496"></a> is the party's merchant factor in
	Seagate, finding cargoes for the party's ships and selling the
	incoming cargoes.
      </p><p><b>Evan. </b>
	A strange, gray, enormously strong dwarf-like being who was
	rescued by the party from a spider web in the Caves at
	Smugglers' Cove,
	Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094723464"></a> has a
	definite affinity for stone and has proven himself a masterly
	weapon-smith, reforging Narung with the help of Chelm and
	Bolg.  He was last seen wandering south through the Atrusian
	hills, leaving the party (in disgust?) after their escape from
	the stronghold of the (unjustly?) murdered Necromancer,
	Mordraug.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094724328"></a>
      </p><p><b>Gerrod. </b>
	A marine sergeant whom the party lost in the Spider
	Hall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094726088"></a> in
	the caves behind Smugglers' Cove and then rescued from the
	Arkanians at Finn's Waste,
	Gerrod<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094726728"></a> was
	foolishly grateful for the rescue and asked the Count to
	retire him into the party's service.  He now is the so-called
	`butler' of the party, when their house isn't exploded and
	burned to the ground, and has proved an invaluable servant and
	ally, as well as a invaluable source of knowledge about the
	Carzala military.
      </p><p><b>Gh'yal. </b>
	Gh'yal<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094728792"></a> was the
	leader of the Jetaleem, and is the one the party has to thank
	for convincing the other Jetaleem that they were indeed
	intelligent, and would not be a suitable breakfast snack.  He
	also talked the party into killing the evil wizard
	Moghu<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094729576"></a> in return
	for an escort to the north side of the Salt Sea.
      </p><p><b>Girfalath. </b>
	The captain of one of the party's ships,
	Girfalath<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094731720"></a>
	is an Elf, completely frivolous when off duty, but completely
	serious when on duty or on his ship.
      </p><p><b>Hajj. </b>
	A true Prophet,
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094733560"></a> was rescued
	(or kidnapped, depending on your viewpoint) by the party from
	the danger of assassination south of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094734232"></a> at
	the request of the ruler of Marv Dashlam and brought north to
	safety.  His politics and philosophy tend to offend the
	priests of most religions, emphasizing reason and equality as
	they do, and it is hard to decide if he is a holy man, a
	philosopher or a troublemaker.
      </p><p><b>Harun. </b>
	Harun<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094736232"></a> was the tribal
	champion<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094736792"></a> of
	the Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094737352"></a>
	that Basgoot defeated in the Auhaami tradition so that the
	party might enter an oasis in the party's first encounter with
	the Auhaami of the Gatar Shey.
      </p><p><b>Ilene. </b>
	A beautiful young woman rescued from an enchanted sleep in a
	underground stronghold in the wilderness at the behest of
	Balour Shaw,
	Ilene<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094739368"></a> is
	rebuilding Balour Shaw's tower, helped by a group of
	untalkative
	Dwarves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094739992"></a>
      </p><p><b>Karl Blue-tooth. </b>
	Karl Blue-tooth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094741720"></a> was the guide the party hired
	to help them find the source of the Wolf River in search of
	Mordraug.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094742376"></a>
	His unpleasant personality and crude personal habits ensured
	that the party did not grieve when he did not return from the
	journey, after he had abandoned them near their destination.
      </p><p><b>The Mage. </b>
	The party has offended this powerful
	mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094744328"></a> on
	several occassions.  They really have no idea who he is or
	what he is about, although he seems to be involved with
	Suliman Trade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094745000"></a>
      </p><p><b>Melthal Heavy-hand. </b>
	Melthal Heavy-hand<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094746744"></a> is a recently retired army
	officer who ranked high in the Count of Carzala's service, and
	who still retains numerous friends there.  He was Basgoot's
	first contact in Carzala.  He is a gruff and testy person
	whose trust is not easily won.  He lives on a large farm with
	his family somewhere not far from Seagate.
      </p><p><b>Moghu. </b>
	Moghu<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094748808"></a> was a
	tyrannical evil wizard and ruler and the creator of the Sand
	Golems;<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094749416"></a>
	the party slew him to free the
	Jetaleem.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094749992"></a>
      </p><p><b>Mordraug. </b>
	A powerful necromancer and healer who lived in seclusion in a
	stronghold he gained from the
	Dwarves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094752200"></a> in
	olden times for healing their king,
	Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094752728"></a> was
	sought out by the party to replace Gim's missing leg and heal
	Balour Shaw's mental and physical injuries.  The party paid
	for this with a month of their lives, which they do not
	remember.  He later caused
	Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094753480"></a> to be
	reforged and helped imprison the demon in the sword, but was
	foully murdered immediately afterward by Basgoot, fulfilling a
	bargain made with
	Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094754168"></a>, the
	orcish-named Dwarf who also helped reforge Narung.
      </p><p><b>Mother Thistle. </b>
	An old woman living alone in a cottage deep in the Thornwoood
	Forest, Mother Thistle<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094756040"></a> help heal the party.
      </p><p><b>The Necromancer. </b>
	The party has offended this powerful
	necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094757832"></a> on several occassions.  They
	really don't know who he is or what he is about.
      </p><p><b>Polam Wesved. </b>
	A rich land holder in the Brastor Holding,
	<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094759688"></a> became
	an enemy of the party.
      </p><p><b>Selye Storm-watcher. </b>
	Selye Storm-watcher<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094761480"></a> is a prosperous, if
	eccentric, resident of Gurgnir's Hope who was Cormac
	Tricerius's first contact in Carzala.  Although his adventures
	have made him plenty of money, he still spends much of his
	time adventuring or exploring the lands around Carzala, often
	alone.  His name comes from his habit of wandering around in
	and watching storms, especially violent ones.
      </p><p><b>Rayesta. </b>
	A nomad girl from the Sea of Grass,
	Rayesta<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094763624"></a> was
	trading in the Brastor Holding when Polam Wesved tried to
	abduct her.  She fled to Blackstone Chapel, where the PCs held
	off several attacks by Wesved's thugs.
      </p><p><b>Remy Gill<a href="#ftn.idp140274094765112" class="footnote" name="idp140274094765112"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>. </b>
	A very young Elf, Remy Gill<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094766264"></a> is nonetheless a very accomplished
	military
	engineer,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094766856"></a> having worked on both sides in
	many seiges.
      </p><p><b>Slehad. </b>
	Slehad<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094768904"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094769304"></a> was the quirky and interesting
	Fire Giant who entertained the party in his tower overlooking
	the cliffs of the Mountain Wall and the Gatar Shey.
	Unfortunately for the party, he turned out to have disturbing
	habits and dietary tastes and human and elvish corpses in his
	larder.
      </p><p><b>Steffan. </b>
	A young officer in the Count's court,
	Steffan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094771368"></a> is a
	pleasant young man with a taste for gambling and intrigue, but
	he is extremely devoted to the Count, who trusts him with
	difficult assignments.  Steffan is probably one of the party's
	best supporters at court.
      </p><p><b>Tathlam Dargan. </b>
	The Baron of Seagate, Tathlam Dargan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094773352"></a> is an
	enemy of the party, in part because of their disruption of his
	once peaceful community, in part due to their actions towards
	Amur Gibbetsmaster, and no doubt in part for other
	reasons.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094774088" class="footnote" name="idp140274094774088"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a>
      </p><p><b>Tamhas. </b>
	Tamhas<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094776568"></a> was the
	captain of one of the detachments of marines that accompanied
	the party back to Smugglers' Cove to retrieve the ships and
	their cargo.
      </p><p><b>Tekhadun. </b>
	(Deceased.)  A dwarf who was forced to join the party when
	they were geased to travel to the Kingdoms of the Five
	Sisters,
	Tekhadun<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094778568"></a> was
	bad-tempered and prideful, but a master of the axe.  He died
	in the south, killed while fighting a Chimera.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094779224" class="footnote" name="idp140274094779224"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a>
      </p><p><b>Tully Glas. </b>
	Tully Glas<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094781272"></a>

      </p><p><b>Tychel. </b>
        Head priest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094784424"></a>

	Uillean Kawiyr<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094786216"></a> was the captain of one of the

      </p><p><b>Ulfred. </b>
	Ulfred<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094788088"></a> is
	another of the military
	engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094788664"></a>
	that the party hired to build the road.  He is a very short
	but very broad man, his hair beginning to grey, with a short
	steel-grey beard.
      </p><p><b>Vlad Sharp-knife. </b>
	Vlad Sharp-knife<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094790968"></a> is a prosperous merchant
	based in Crystal Springs who was Gim Torson's first contact in
	Carzala.  He has suggested the party to several persons
	looking for adventurers to do jobs, has helped them find
	merchants who might be interested in the South and helping
	build the road, and has acted as a consultant to help the
	party get their merchant company started.  He is extremely
	curious, but now that he is getting older he usually leaves
	the adventuring to others.  His name comes from the many
	daggers he invariable carries, some concealed, that he has
	been known to use on those who try to cheat him.
      </p><p><b>Yavidi. </b>
	Yavidi<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094793320"></a> is the

	  Originally the position of Baron of
	  Seagate was traditionally given to one of the Count of
	  Carzala's younger sons, and the Baron worked closely with
	  the Count.  However, at one point in the past the position
	  went to one of the Count's daughters, a very unusual woman,
	  and when she died the position was given to her husband, a
	  very popular member of court, and when he died it was given
	  to his son by his first wife.  Thus eventually it was
	  inherited (more-or-less) by Tathlam Dargan.

      Following is a recounting of the events of each adventure in
      the order they happened, arranged by adventure rather than
      by playing session, but with possible dates of play
      following each adventure.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094797960" class="footnote" name="idp140274094797960"><sup class="footnote">[11]</sup></a>

	The party traveled to Crystal Springs, where Gim
	Torson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094800024"></a>
	gave Vlad Sharp-knife,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094800584"></a> a retired merchant and
	adventurer, a letter of introduction.  Vlad suggested that the
	Mayor of Crystal Springs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094801256"></a> might hire them.  The mayor,
	Kesdra,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094801848"></a> hired
	them to get rid of two
	ogres<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094802424"></a> who had
	moved down out of the Fastness of Girwyllan and were
	way-laying travelers and outlying farms.  (The guards of
	Regir's Keep<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094803096"></a> were occupied to the south, hunting
	down several large bands of
	outlaws<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094803704"></a> in
	the Sweet Riding.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094804264"></a>) While the party searched for the
	ogres, the ogres ambushed them on the road.  When the party
	proved more than the ogres could handle the ogres fled to
	their nearby subterranean lair.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094804984"></a> The party followed and killed them.
	Among the debris was a map the party could not
	read.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094805880"></a>
      </p><p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up two potions of
	  healing and one map in an ornate bone scroll case.  The
	  potions have been used and the map has been followed.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094807640"></a>

	The wealthy merchant
	Rasson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094811320"></a> hired
	the party to rescue his son,
	Turon.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094811896"></a> Three
	months before, Turon had been abducted by an enemy of
	Rasson's, a mage.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094812520"></a> The mage drove Turon mad and turned
	him loose in the Wilderlands of
	Gilarni,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094813128"></a> a forest territory claimed by
	Elves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094813720"></a> When
	Rasson found out he sent his men to bring his son back, but
	they were ambushed and massacred by the Elves, for Turon in
	his madness had attacked and killed an Elf, and the Elves in
	turn were killing any humans in the forest in retaliation.
	After this Rasson hired the party because one of them was an
	Elf.
      </p><p>
	On the way to the Wilderlands of Gilarni the party stayed at
	the inn at Arn's Ferry,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094815064"></a> where they were attacked by an
	assassin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094815640"></a> who (as they found out afterwards)
	carried a strange coin: it was a large gold coin, not one that
	any of the party had ever see, and was obviously carved rather
	than minted.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094816376"></a>
	
	They survived the attack, but were thrown out of the inn and
	could only find lodging in a strange tower inhabited by an
	even stranger old man,
	Balour Shaw,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094817432"></a>
	who habitually spoke in a 
	<span class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span>
	enigmatic
	manner.  The next morning they found three more assassins
	frozen to death outside the tower; each carried one of the
	strange gold coins.
      </p><p>
	Once in the Wilderlands of Gilarni, the party was accosted by
	Elves, but Gim Torson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094819000"></a> convinced the Elves that allowing
	the party to complete their mission was something to be
	desired by all involved (expect The
	Mage,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094819672"></a> of
	course) and that Turon was not responsible for his actions.
	The party rescued Turon from the riverside
	cave<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094820328"></a>
	where he was living (battering him somewhat in the process),
	disposed of some of the mage's henchmen who attacked them, and
	returned Turon to his father Rasson.  Gim Torson later
	revisited Balour Shaw and began learning magic from
	him.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094821112"></a>
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This adventure was gamed sometime in 1985<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094822616"></a>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp140274094823928"></a>5.3. To Clear the Crypts of Stonesboro</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Rasson recommended the party to
	Tomon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094824920"></a> who was
	looking for a group of adventurers to investigate the rumors
	that something was living in the burial crypts near
	Stonesboro.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094825592"></a>
	The crypts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094826136"></a> turned out to be inhabited by
	various ruffians, sub-humans, and undead, most of which were
	in the service of a
	necromancer,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094826808"></a>
	though the party only figured this out later, near the end of
	the adventure.
      </p><p>
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094827832"></a>
      was killed early on.  Barlow Smythe was
      killed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094829080"></a>
    while bravely and selflessly holding off some of the monsters
    in an early retreat, and was replaced by his friend
    Kalo Bibkins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094830408"></a>
  a choice that had a dark and significant impact on the party's
  future.
      </p><p>
	During the clearing of the caves, the party met the Ghost of
	Harmon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094832152"></a>
      who asked that one among them take up his sword and clear the
      crypts of Undead; Basgoot accepted, and was
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094833736"></a>
    to kill all the undead in the crypts and their maker.  The
    sword, a magic bastard sword, was named
    Narung.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094835512"></a> Later
    the party met a madman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094836088"></a>
  in the crypts, who offered them a drink from his wineskin.
  Basgoot again accepted, and was drunk for
  days.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094837016"></a>
      </p><p>
	Finally the party killed the necromancer after an epic battle
	with all of his remaining undead servants, among whom, alas,
	Bytor<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094838616"></a>
      was now numbered.  Afterwards they freed a group of
      Dwarves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094839880"></a>
    who had been captured by the necromancer and were being forced
    to build tunnels for him.
    
      </p><p>
	At some time before, during, or after this adventure, the
	party was summoned to a warehouse where a menacing figure
	warned them that they had crossed him once, and must never
	again do so.  The crates in the warehouse were marked with the
	sign of Suliman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094842456"></a>
      Trade.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094843256" class="footnote" name="idp140274094843256"><sup class="footnote">[12]</sup></a>
      </p><p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up five books and one
	  box of mysterious powder from the from the necromancer's
	  library, one wand of Fire and Brimstone, and a small pouch
	  of red balls that expanded and then exploded.  The pouch has
	  been emptied and the books sold.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094845224"></a>

	The party contracted to defend a religious community of
	healers in the hills south of the
	Brastor Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094849192"></a>
      and the South Lending.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094850008"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094850664"></a>
    The community had angered Polam
    Wesved,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094851528"></a>
  a powerful and unscrupulous merchant, by offering shelter to
  Rayesta,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094852392"></a>
a beautiful Horse Nomad warrior that Wesved had tried to
abduct and enslave.  She beat off the kidnappers, but was
severely injured; fleeing into the southern hills, she
stumbled into Blackstone Chapel, a small religious community,
where she was taken in and healed.  Wesved told the community
to return her to him, and when they refused gave them three
weeks to change their minds, threatening violence if they did
not.
      </p><p>
	Since they were basically pacifistic and did not have the
	skills to defend their community and Rayesta from Wesved's
	thugs, the Chapel sent one of their most trusted men,
	Tychel,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094854216"></a> to
	complain to the authorities in the South Lending.  These,
	however, told him it was out of their jurisdiction, since the
	Chapel was beyond the borders of the Brastor
	Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094854936"></a> (perhaps acting under the
	influence of Polam Wesved).  Desperate, Tychel sought out a
	group of adventurers, on his own, to bring them back to
	protect the community.  On the way to Blackstone Chapel they
	were ambushed, but most survived, and even the fatalities
	were<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094855752"></a> resurrected.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094856584" class="footnote" name="idp140274094856584"><sup class="footnote">[13]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	After a furious debate, the community decided that it was
	morally permissible for them to hire the adventurers to defend
	the community.  There were several attacks, which were beaten
	off at the cost of several party members (including at least
	Gim and Cormac).<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094858616"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094859672"></a>
      However, the party
      members were resurrected<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094860936"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094861992"></a>
    by the grateful community's deity, and eventually
    <a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094863256"></a>
    gave up this approach to regaining Rayesta.
      </p><p>
	When they returned to the South Lending, the party was
	arrested<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094864312"></a>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094865496"></a>
      since they had been accused by Polam Wesved of
      stealing a valuable slave (Rayesta) and killing his henchmen
      who were (he claimed) in lawful pursuit of her.
      Unfortunately for Wesved, the judge whose compliance he had
      bought was replaced at the last minute by the new Laird of
      the South Lending, and the final decision was against him.

	(This scenario was a solo adventure for
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094869944"></a>
	Torson.)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094870488"></a> Gim Torson was summoned to
	Balour Shaw's tower by a talking
	owl<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094871368"></a> to
	repay some of the debts Gim had incurred as a student of
	Shaw's magic.  After the usual confusing preliminaries, Balour
	Shaw sent Gim out searching for
	Jomanal,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094872072"></a> an
	adventurer fairly well known in Seagate, who disappeared while
	working for Balour Shaw some time before.
      </p><p>
	Gim followed his trail and found out that Jomanal disappeared
	in the mountains near Crystal
	Springs,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094873224"></a> about a month before the party
	killed the
	Ogres<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094873832"></a> in that
	area, apparently in search of a treasure.  It turned out that
	the map<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094874456"></a> that the
	party found amongst the ogres' loot belonged to Jomanal, and
	was the map to the treasure for which Jomanal was looking.
	Balour Shaw also thought the map would lead to something for
	which he had long sought.

	The party set out to find the treasure Jomanal thought lay
	at the end of the map, and Balour Shaw asked them to keep an
	eye out for a particular book in which he was interested.
      </p><p>
	They ran into some slight problems on the way out, because
	Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094879064"></a>
	Bibkins had stolen the purse of an extremely important, not to
	mention malicious and wealthy,
	nobleman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094879704"></a> (committing the infamous and
	almost legendary grand theft
	pickpocket)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094880328"></a> slightly before they were
	scheduled to leave.  He was vigorously sought by the town
	guards, but with the help of the Thieves
	Guild<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094881016"></a>
	(for which he paid dearly) he was smuggled out of town in the
	carcass of a slaughtered animal and joined the rest of the
	party on their trek into the wilderness, although they made
	him travel downwind for several days, until the stench
	subsided.  Following the hints on the map, they finally
	discovered a hidden stronghold at the head of the Tiana River,
	east of Carzala.
      </p><p>
	When they tried to enter the stronghold, they were attacked by
	a Water Elemental<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094882424"></a> in a pool beside the entrance.
	Kalo's pony<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094882968"></a> was frightened and fell into the
	pool with Kalo astride it.  Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094883848"></a> attacked the elemental with a
	lightning bolt since that was the party's most effective
	magical offense, and badly damaged the elemental, but it also
	damaged Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094884552"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094884952"></a> and the pony, both now
	involuntarily swimming in the pool.  The blast electrocuted
	the pony, but by some miracle Kalo survived, barely.  After
	searching around some more, they found another entrance, an
	rock-lined shaft down into the ground.
	Boswt<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094886136"></a> slipped
	from the slime-covered hand and footholds while climbing down
	the shaft
	and<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094886760"></a> died.
      </p><p>
	The stronghold had been deserted for centuries, during which
	various foul creatures had moved in.  After a few amusing
	incidents with hallucinogenic mushrooms and
	fungi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094888136"></a>
	the party found a large room, in the center of which was a
	large pentacle and inside that a silvery but semi-transparent
	dome.  Under the dome was a beautiful young
	woman,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094888856"></a>
	apparently asleep, and the book which Balour Shaw sought.  The
	dome was impenetrable to all their efforts to open it.
      </p><p>
	They returned to Balour Shaw, who accompanied them back to the
	stronghold and opened the dome.  The woman remained entranced.
	On the way back to civilization they were twice attacked, once
	by six men led by an
	assassin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094890136"></a> (who turned out to be carrying a
	strange carved gold coin)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094890744"></a> and once by a
	necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094891320"></a>
	who led six other men.  With the help of Balour Shaw they
	survived.  During one of the attacks
	Basgoot's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094891960"></a>
	sword, Narung,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094892520"></a> began to hum; the person he had
	just struck screamed, then shriveled up and was seemingly
	absorbed by the sword.  Basgoot's eyes turned completely
	black, the blade of the sword glowed blindingly, and then
	Basgoot's eyes closed, he said <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">oh</span>”</span>, and he dropped to the
	ground.  He was unconscious till the party returned to
	civilization.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094893832" class="footnote" name="idp140274094893832"><sup class="footnote">[14]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	When they left Balour Shaw he was researching how to wake the
	woman.  When
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094895528"></a>
	finally awoke, his eyes were normal again.
      </p><p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up a massive book,
	  which Balour Shaw claimed, six unreadable books, which were
	  sold, a ring, a horn, a rod of lightning, eight vials of
	  healing potion, and two vials of invisibility.  All of the
	  vials were used up rather quickly.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094897448"></a>

	Alas, Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094901784"></a>
	brought his past crashing down upon himself 
	<span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
	the rest of the party.
	Upon returning to Seagate, Kalo sent a taunting letter to
	the nobleman whom he had pickpocketed.  Unfortunately for
	Kalo, the nobleman had no sense of humor, and hired a bounty
	hunter<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094902984"></a>
	
	to track Kalo down.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094904040"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094904440"></a> The bounty hunter did, and
	delivered Kalo to the local dungeon and an eagerly awaiting
	torturer.
      </p><p>
	Under torture,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094905656"></a> Kalo incriminated the
	party<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094906488"></a> in his earlier escape from
	Seagate, and the party was arrested by order of Amur
	Gibbetsmaster.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094907400"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094907816"></a> The party was forced to watch
	Kalo's beheading, a singularly botched exhibition, since the
	executioner<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094908728"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094909128"></a> was blind drunk.  It took
	him six blows to kill Kalo,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094909992"></a> and even then Kalo's head was not
	completely severed from his body.  The surviving party members
	were themselves offered a choice: death, or a

	The party took the plains route to the South, but were forced
	into the ominous Thornwood Forest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094921320"></a> by the Horse
	Nomads.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094921896"></a>
	In the forest they stumbled upon a clearing, in which there
	were several statues and a tiny hut.  The wizened old woman
	who lived in the hut introduced herself as Mother
	Thistle<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094922616"></a> (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Mother Thistle Knows!</span>”</span>), and
	invited them inside.  Surprisingly enough they all fit.
      </p><p>
	Once they were inside she spoke obscurely of three mages who
	had touched the party: The Mage, The Necromancer, and Balour
	Shaw, saying that they had angered the first two twice
	each.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094924216"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094924616"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094925032"></a> She then went on to say that the
	Hand of the Otherworld had touched all of the party, and had
	possessed one of them.  She warned that the dead could help
	them, but could also destroy, and that the desert's most
	powerful dangers were also the least obvious.
      </p><p>
	When they left her hut the next day, they found they were on
	the southern edge of the forest, though there was no way they
	could have traveled that far before finding the hut.
      </p><p><a name="ghostsKorsepolis"></a>
	South of the Forest was the Vale of
	Morin,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094927320"></a>
	once the site of fierce battles against the Horse Nomads.
	During their first day in the Vale the party saw the Horse
	Nomads who had chased them earlier, but the nomads, though
	they obviously saw the party, did not enter the Vale.  Later,
	the party was accosted by a group of
	Ghosts,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094928136"></a> who asked about the state of their
	city, Korsepolis.  Upon learning that
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094928776"></a>
	had been in ruins for centuries, the Ghosts traded the party a
	promise of safe passage across the Vale in return for the
	party's oath to reestablish trade with the Kingdoms of the
	Five Sisters and resettle
	Korsepolis.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094929528"></a> Since the former they were
	already <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span> to do and the later was a
	matter for the future, they agreed, as the best bargain in the
	situation.  The Ghosts also told the party that Korsepolis
	
	had the best roads
	through the mountains to the desert, and so would be the
	easiest route to the desert.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094931208" class="footnote" name="idp140274094931208"><sup class="footnote">[16]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094932328"></a>
      </p><p>
	The party found Korsepolis in the mouth of a valley that led
	up into the mountains.  They snuck through the city after
	dark, almost blundered into a
	war<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094933400"></a> between orcs and hobgoblins,
	and then followed the road out of Korsepolis into the
	mountains.  The road crossed the mountains and ended at a
	tower overlooking a one thousand foot drop to the desert: this
	was the Mountain Wall from which these mountains took their
	name.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094934248"></a>

	They were invited into the tower by a elderly, pleasant
	seeming if somewhat quirky Fire Giant,
	Slehad<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094937704"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094938104"></a>
	He told them about the tower, and the track that descended to
	the desert, and mentioned that he left Carzala three hundred
	years ago, soon after it was settled by humans.  However,
	during the night he attacked the party, and it was only with
	the greatest of struggles that they defeated him.  They
	explored the tower and found that his larder was stocked with
	human and elvish corpses.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094939032"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094939704"></a>
      </p><p> 
	In the tower they also found a curious clay
	ball,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094940952"></a> a
	chest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094941496"></a> and a small box.  The small box
	proved to contain a moderate quantity of an unknown

	Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094942680"></a>
	broke the ball, releasing a strange shadow-like
	creature,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094943272"></a> and found that the ball also
	enclosed a key.  When Jamie used the key to open the chest the
	key bit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094943928"></a>
	him.  Later, Jamie ingested some of the drug from the box and
	experienced strange hallucinations and euphoria.
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094944584"></a> summoned the Giant's spirit
	back to explain the strange contents of the chest, but the
	Giant's answers were obscure at best, and not of much use.
      </p><p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up a scroll with
	  three spells inscribed upon it, broke open one small clay
	  ball which turned out to have a biting key and a shadow
	  creature in it, and ten other clay balls, one of which was
	  later broken when warring against the Queen of the

	The party left the watchtower and climbed down the cliff to
	the desert.  Once out upon the desert they were attacked by
	strange insect-like humanoids, but managed to defeat them.
	They came to an oasis, but found it inhabited by the
	Kaval-tu-Ata,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094951144"></a>
	a tribe of Auhaami, the nomads of the Gatar
	Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094951736"></a> (the
	Southern name for the desert).  According to the customs of
	the tribe, they were allowed to enter the oasis after the
	party's champion
	(Basgoot)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094952424"></a>
	defeated the tribe's champion, Harun.  They found out that the
	insect-like humanoids were the
	Thri-Kreen,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094953064"></a>
	a race found in many places on the desert.  The party stayed
	with the tribe for a while.  The sheik,
	Yavidi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094953720"></a> hired
	them to retrieve some religious items, the
	Cup<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094954312"></a> and the
	Talisman,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094954856"></a>
	from
	Batik-al-Yazum,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094955416"></a>
	a local wizard, who had stolen them from the tribe.  In
	return, the sheik offered to outfit them for their journey
	over the desert and to supply a guide, and told them
	Batik-al-Yazum and most of his servants were absent.
      </p><p>
	The party accepted, and set out for Batik-al-Yazum's tower in
	Sumaldi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094956648"></a> a
	ruined city and oasis a few days travel away.  They were
	attacked by a party of ghouls in the city, and during the
	fight
	Basgoot's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094957320"></a>
	sword again began to
	hum.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094957880"></a> This
	time, both Basgoot and the ghoul screamed, at the same pitch,
	and Basgoot
	<span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094958776"></a> his armor turned black,
	his skin became the color of yellowed ivory, he grew half a
	foot taller, and the ghoul shriveled up and blew away.  He and
	the sword killed five more ghouls, absorbing each one, and
	then Basgoot attacked Jamie,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094959816"></a> the nearest member of the party,
	slicing through the magical Wall of Force with which
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094960440"></a> had encircled the party.
	Basgoot tried to resist the influence of the sword and the
	rest of the party managed to pull him off Jamie, whereupon he
	collapsed.
      </p><p>
	The party continued with its mission, and succeeded in
	reclaiming the Cup and the Talisman, killing several of
	Batik-al-Yazum's servants in the process.  They returned to
	the nomad camp, where they continued learning how to live in
	the desert, how to ride the lizards that were the desert's
	most common form of
	transportation,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094961880"></a>
	and how to speak the language of the South.

	The
	Thri-Kreen,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094965336"></a>
	the insectoids who had ambushed the party when they first
	ventured upon the desert, attacked the nomads in force one
	evening, carrying off fifteen men and thirty women, along with
	one-hundred thirty-seven herd beasts.  The party agreed to
	accompany the nomads on a raid to Tuath's
	Rest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094966168"></a>
	where the Thri-Kreen were living in caves in the hills, to
	recover the captives before they were eaten.
      </p><p>
	The party helped scout and plan the attack, and Gim Torson
	called up a storm as a distraction,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094967320"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094967720"></a> but he succeeded beyond
	his wildest dreams, and it became a race to defeat the
	Thri-Kreen and recover the prisoners before the caves in which
	they were imprisoned flooded.
	Winther,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094968456"></a> who
	summoned a fire elemental<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094969016"></a> to attack the Thri-Kreen, was
	also successful, but ended up with an intelligent,
	self-willed, and very independent, if immature and brash, fire
	elemental, who assisted in the assault only for the chaotic
	fun of it.
      </p><p>
	During the assault on the caves, the Thri-Kreen Queen was on
	the verge of defeating the party and the nomads with her magic
	and guards, when
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094970328"></a> in
	desperation surrendered himself to the control of the sword.
	The sword killed the Queen and then cracked open the mountain,
	starting an earthquake that collapsed the Thri-Kreen caves.
	Luckily, all the party and the surviving nomads escaped the
	cave-in, carrying Basgoot, who had again collapsed into
	unconsciousness.
      </p><p>
	Basgoot had again changed,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094971608"></a> and now had pointed
	ears, hardened talon-like nails, an inhuman look to his face,
	deep crimson skin slightly scaled, black hair, and completely
	black eyes.  He was seven feet tall, and weighed 400 pounds.
	His skin had also become incredibly tough.
      </p><p>
	During the attack Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094973096"></a> broke open one of the strange
	clay balls<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094973672"></a>
	from the chest they had found in the Fire

	The nomads moved to Tuath's Rest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094980408"></a> after the water subsided, partially
	to prevent another hive of Thri-Kreen from moving in.  The
	party finally left for the south, taking with them a chest of
	treasure<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094981112"></a> that the nomads had found in the
	ravine, which they agreed to trade for various things the
	tribe wanted in return for a share of the profits.  Their
	guide was
	Dahlil,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094981832"></a> who
	had visited the Kingdoms of the Five Sisters before.  They
	took a road he was not very familiar with because the more
	familiar road led to two kingdoms currently at war where the
	party would not have been welcome.  Along the way they
	encountered sand-storms and various unfriendly denizens of the
	desert.
      </p><p>
	One of the oasis they found was surrounded by nomad
	tents,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094983144"></a> but the inhabitants (the
	Lakal<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094983736"></a> tribe)
	and all their animals had been beaten to death by blunt
	instruments, and the well had been fouled with their bodies.
	Desperately in need of water, the party headed south to the
	nearest oasis.  Along the way they were constantly harassed by
	creatures made of sand.  They finally reached the oasis, which
	was located in a small range of mountains; while they were at
	the oasis they were attacked by a
	Roc,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094984696"></a> and some of
	their pack and riding
	lizards<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094985256"></a> were
	killed.
      </p><p>
	Fleeing south, they found that their way out of the mountains
	and onto the desert was blocked by a huge
	sandwhip,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094986328"></a> a creature that lives under the
	sand and entangles any animals that walk over it in its many
	tentacles.  This one was huge, over three hundred feet in
	diameter.  Unable to return the way they come because of the
	Roc and other monsters, they first tried to poison the
	sandwhip.<a href="#ftn.idp140274094987144" class="footnote" name="idp140274094987144"><sup class="footnote">[17]</sup></a>
      When that was unsuccessful, Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094988968"></a> Torson summoned the Roc, although
      he was unable to control it; the sandwhip attacked the Roc,
      and in the ensuing battle the party slipped by.

	In Sev-a-kalam, the party was warned that the southernmost
	reaches of the desert were plagued by bandits, so they
	joined a Auhaami caravan leaving for the next oasis, ten
	days away.  Five days out, they were attacked by maniacs,
	and several people on the caravan, including Tekhadun and
	one other character,<a href="#ftn.idp140274094994472" class="footnote" name="idp140274094994472"><sup class="footnote">[18]</sup></a>
      were captured, and several loaded camels are also
      stolen.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094995416"></a> The caravan master,
      Djavh,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094996280"></a>
      identified the attackers by the eight-pointed
      cross<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094996888"></a> tattooed on one of them as
      Arakanisi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094997480"></a>
      worshipers of the
      demon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094998056"></a>
      Arakan,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094998600"></a> King
      of Chaos, who requires human sacrifices.
      </p><p>
	Following the Arakanisi, the party and the warriors from the
	caravan found a series of caves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274094999672"></a>
      in the Salt Sea, but alas!  only guards remained:
      the captives had already been taken elsewhere.  Investigating,
      they killed the guards and found several corpses.  In one
      room, apparently formed from the ribs of a huge skeleton, they
      found an altar in front of a statue of beautiful artistry but
      unsettling aspect.  Behind the altar was a huge red vertical
      stone block across the room, in the center of which was a
      vertical whirlpool of flame.  Tracks in the blood and dust of
      the room showed that this was where the Arakanisi and the
      remaining captives had gone.
      </p><p>
	The party and several Auhaami crossed through the flames, and
	found themselves in a strange place: the sky was green, the
	grass blue, and a river was red; a miniature sun, moon, and
	stars circled in the sky, and the clouds were white, blue,
	red, brown, and black, and in constant rapid motion.  This was
	Makad-al-Arakan, the world of
	Arakan.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095002632"></a>
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095003176"></a> drank from the red river and
	began to praise<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095003768"></a> Arakan.  (Cormac experienced
	these fits intermittently thereafter for a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> time, until cured
	by<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095005096"></a>
	Mordraug.)
      </p><p>
	Following the tracks the party came to an amphitheater, in the
	center of which was a throne.
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095006152"></a> sat
	on the throne and was blasted by lightning, but
	survived.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095006760"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095007432"></a> The party then went back along
	the road and took the other fork, which led them to a
	steep-walled valley containing a heavily guarded prison-like
	structure, which turned out to be where those abducted from
	the caravan were being held.
      </p><p><a name="narungsdemon"></a>
	While attempting to bypass the guards along the road to where
	the prisoners were held, Basgoot called upon Narung, his
	cursed magic sword.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095009336"></a> A huge
	demonic<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095010168"></a> figure
	burst forth
	
	from the sword, breaking it into pieces, and grew until his
	head touched the sky.  Basgoot fell into a coma and his body
	became rigid, but he lost some of his more demonic exterior
	characteristics.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095011320"></a>
	He shrank to six foot four and a mere three
	hundred pounds, his skin returned to the color of yellowed
	ivory, and he lost most of the scaled areas on his skin and
	completely lost his talons.  The sky cracked open and
	another huge demonic figure stepped in and the two figures
	began to fight.
      </p><p>
	In the confusion and destruction of the ensuing battle
	the party rescued the prisoners, who included many not from
	the caravan.  They all then fled through the rapidly
	disintegrating world back towards the entrance, carrying
	their wounded and unconscious, with Basgoot still clinging
	to the shards of Narung.  Alas, upon reaching the entrance
	they found it closed.  An ancient man, one of the prisoners,
	said that it could only be opened by sacrifice, and offered
	himself:<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095013320"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095013720"></a>
	Gim Torson, one of the few still conscious and capable of
	making decisions, instantly, without the slightest
	hesitation or remorse, accepted the old man's sacrifice and
	chopped his head off, leaving the corpse spouting blood over
	the altar.  The entrance opened and they all passed through
	to the caves in the desert.
      </p><p>
	There was not enough water with the caravan for all the
	prisoners, so some were left in the caves while the caravan
	headed for Akhisar, the closest city, to report the actions
	of the Arakanisi and arrange transportation for the other
	prisoners.  Alas, by the time they had returned to the cave
	with transport and Akhisar's warriors, those they had left
	behind had been smashed against the sides and ceilings of
	the caves.  Basgoot remained mind-burnt, and Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095015720"></a>
	still had
	fits frequently.

	The characters were interviewed by the
	captain<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095019144"></a> of Akhisar's city guard about the
	events in the caves and beyond.  Impressed, he suggested they
	seek work with the city guard, or as warriors of the Bey, the
	local ruler.  The party stayed in Akhisar for a while, getting
	Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095019928"></a> cured by a sorcerer and
	resting up.
	Basgoot,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095020520"></a>
	unfortunately, remained mind-burnt.
      </p><p>
	However, one day they met a ragged old man, seemingly a water
	or wine seller, who quoted poetry (not to their taste) at
	them, offered them a drink from his skin, and spoke to them
	most familiarly and obscurely, saying that he came to help a
	follower fallen on evil times, and asked them to lead him to
	their fallen comrade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095021816"></a> When they did, he gave Basgoot a
	drink, and Basgoot became roaring-and-falling-down drunk.
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095022472"></a> asked
	for a drink, which the old man gladly supplied him, but upon
	drinking Winther fell into stupor and
	unconsciousness.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095023128"></a> Basgoot remained drunk for a
	day, but when he sobered up he had recovered from his
	mind-burn.
      </p><p>
	After a few days in the city a
	merchant<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095024488"></a> invited them to visit and talk
	of their journey.  Also impressed, he told them they might
	easily find work for him or for the merchants' council.
      </p><p>
	They eventually went to work for the city
	guard.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095025896"></a> After a few weeks patrolling in
	the city, the captain of the guard sent them out to kill some
	monsters that were troubling caravans along the trade route.
	Along the way they rescued a Jann<a href="#ftn.idp140274095026920" class="footnote" name="idp140274095026920"><sup class="footnote">[19]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095027640"></a>
	from a group of Brigands.  The grateful Jann gave
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095028504"></a> an
	amulet.  Tracking the monsters down, they found three Chimera.
	After a fierce battle the party killed the monsters, but
	Tekhadun died (bravely, of course) in the
	fight.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095029224"></a>

	Two weeks later the party left Akhisar for the nearest of the
	Kingdoms of the Five Sisters, and traveled with a caravan
	through the Saddyahi-Ashban, the mountains between the desert
	and the Kingdoms of the Five Sisters.  The caravan was
	attacked twice by bandits during the trip, and every second
	night a member of the caravan was found dead, apparently
	killed by someone in the caravan.  A Jann war party also
	accosted the caravan; they were raiding in retaliation for
	bloody, savage attacks by human bandits, but when they found
	out Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095033480"></a>
	had saved the life of their sheik's
	son<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095034056"></a>
	(from who came the amulet), the Jann allowed the caravan to
	pass, after the party gave their
	oath<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095034968"></a> to track
	down the bandits who killed the Jannee.  Finally, they reached
	the Castle of the Desert Gate (sometimes called Castle Ashban
	by the hasty), at the pass out of the mountains into the
	plains of the Five Sisters.  There the killer was discovered:
	one of the caravan guards was a
	were-tiger,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095035800"></a>
	who went on a rampage through the castle.  In the ensuing
	fight the were-tiger was killed, but several party members
	were infected and Korbel Noir died.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095036488"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095036888"></a>

	The party left for the nearest city of any size, Marv
	Dashlam,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095039560"></a>
	hoping to be cured.  There they visited the Mages'
	Guild,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095040152"></a> but the cost of a cure was beyond
	their means.  The next morning they were visited by old,
	shabbily dressed man who informed them that if they wished
	freed of their curse they could visit a particular house that
	evening.  During the day they spoke with the merchants of the
	city to fulfill their geas, but the merchants were not
	interested in trade along such a risky route as through the
	Gatar Shey.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095041368"></a> The merchants seemed very
	complacent and unaggressive.
      </p><p>
	That night they visited the house, where a mysterious
	man<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095042408"></a> (who told them to call him
	Albad, though this was obviously not his real
	name)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095043048"></a> of
	obvious authority offered to have them cured if they would
	kidnap a certain holy man named
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095043688"></a> and take
	him back with them to their homeland, under no circumstances
	allowing him to come to harm.  Albad said they had until the
	next evening to consider.  The next day they were approached
	by a priest of the local religion, who spoke of an evil
	heretic, a fiend in human form, and asked them to rid the city
	of this menace.  They did not accept, and the priest left
	angrily, hoping the gods would send them their reward.
      </p><p>
	That night they returned to the house and accepted the
	mysterious man's offer; he had them cured by a master mage,
	then <span class="emphasis"><em>Geased</em></span> to kidnap the holy man.  They
	were joined the next day by
	Jubad,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095045656"></a> who
	somehow knew of their errand
	
	and offered to help them find Hajj.  With his help they did
	find Hajj, who was hidden in the magic garden of one of his
	followers, but when they went to abduct Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095046760"></a>, Jubad attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095047592"></a>
	them and attempted to kill Hajj.  Hajj was injured, but they
	managed to save him.  Jubad escaped, and soon the city was
	up in arms, looking for the villains who had attacked their
	holy man, and perhaps killed him in the process.
      </p><p>
	The priests, of course, still wanted Hajj dead.
      </p><p><b>Magic. </b>
	  Albad gave the characters some magic items to assist them
	  with their task and to pay them for doing it.  They received
	  a knobed cane three feet long that was invested with

	regained consciousness, and agreed to leave the city with the
	party, more concerned with defusing the continuing riots than

	After traveling across the mountains, fleeing with the
	prophet, they entered the gates of Akhisar at dusk and were
	greeted by Abu Darruh<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095062216"></a> one of their friends in the city
	guard.  He told them of the exciting recent occurrences in
	Marv Dashlam, and suggested they put up at the Prophet's
	End,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095062904"></a> an inn of good quality and
	reasonable cost with a reputation for discretion.  Despite the
	ominous name, they decided to do so, as the desert was not
	passable at that time of year, not to mention their ill health
	and general exhaustion.  As it turned out they remained in
	Akhisar for about six months, speaking with the local
	merchants about trade, and working for the city guard.  They
	were visited by a
	Jann,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095063880"></a> who told
	them that the bandits who murdered the Jannee had been killed
	by an Akhisar patrol, so they were freed of that
	oath.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095064552"></a>
      </p><p>
	Half-way through their stay, one morning they found an
	eight-armed cross<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095065544"></a> of blood on the floor of the
	common room of their suite at the inn.  During the day they
	learned that other crosses had appeared in many houses
	throughout the city.  Later they were visited by the captain
	of the guard, who told them that the crosses were threats from
	the Arakanisi.  Later, a message arrived from the
	Albad,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095066424"></a> the
	mysterious man<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095066984"></a> who had hired them in Marv
	Dashlam, warning that the priests of that city were still
	looking for them.
      </p><p>
	Several nights later, Shay Uvall,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095068088"></a> another resident of the inn and
	sometime merchant and mercenary, saw a stranger coming down
	the stairs from the party's rooms.  The second time he saw
	this happening, he warned the party they were being observed.
	A few days later, an assassination attempt was made on Hajj in
	the market,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095068920"></a> and two days later an assassination
	attempt was made upon all of the
	characters<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095069464"></a> while they slept, unable to wake
	because of an enchantment.  Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095070088"></a> Uvall heard the intruders and came
	to the party's rescue.  He struggle with the assassins until
	his efforts to wake the party succeeded, and together they
	managed to kill the assassins.  During the attack Jamie Molson
	died,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095070856"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095071256"></a> but he had enough money with him
	to be resurrected.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095072248"></a>
	
	It was decided that Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095073544"></a> Uvall will accompany them

	They left Akhisar one day after the second assassination
	attempt, accompanied by Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095077736"></a> Uvall and escorting
	Hajj<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095078296"></a> and three
	merchant emissaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095078856"></a> to the north.  The party
	encountered no serious problems in the southern Gatar
	Shey,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095080152"></a> and
	reached Sev-a-kalam without trouble.
      </p><p>
	There the locals warned them that the monsters of the Salt Sea
	were restless.  Nonetheless they set out, and one day as they
	were traveling across a salt flat a huge
	worm-like<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095081320"></a> beast suddenly broke up through the
	ground in front of them, arched over them, and broke back into
	the ground behind them.
      </p><p>
	The salt surface between the two holes cracked open and
	dropped the party twenty-five yards into salt water, where
	the huge worm swam leisurely towards the party, obviously
	congratulating itself on the fine breakfast it had found.
	Just then, however, several small boats loomed up out of the
	dark and one of the creatures in them threw an object into
	the water in front of the worm.  The object exploded with an
	impressive noise, blinding flames, and a truly foul stench,
	and the worm left quickly.  The party wished it could too.
      </p><p>
	The creatures in the boats seemed much like goblins, only
	nicer, and immediately entered into a heated conversation
	amongst themselves.  When the party figured out the debased
	dialect of Auhaami the creatures were using they discovered
	that the creatures were trying to decide whether the party
	members were intelligent, in which case they should be saved,
	or not, in which case they would provide breakfast and lunch,
	and maybe supper.  After some initial difficulty, the party
	convinced most of the creatures, or
	Jetaleem<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095083880"></a> as
	they called themselves, that they were indeed intelligent.
	(Several Jetaleem remained unconvinced, not surprisingly.)
	Gh'yal,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095084552"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095084952"></a> the leader of the Jetaleem,
	told the party that he would resupply them and lead them to
	the northern edge of the Salt Sea if they would depose
	Moghu,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095085912"></a> the evil
	sorcerous tyrant that was oppressing them.  (Imagine a clean
	goblin.  Imagine a clean goblin spouting Marxist rhetoric.
	Imagine a clean goblin spouting Marxist rhetoric at you as you
	float in a salt lake infested with huge worms that have shown
	a distinct interest in having you for
	breakfast.)<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095086760"></a>
      </p><p>
	The party, of course, agreed, took the oath,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095087736"></a>
	and snuck into the despot's underground stronghold, where
	they were pestered by an imp and nearly killed by Sand
	Golems. They succeeded, however, in destroying the despot's
	magical talisman, driving both the despot and his Sand
	Golems mad.  The Jetaleem leader kept his word and escorted
	the party safely to the northern edge of the Salt Sea.
      </p><p>
	The party headed north to the nearest oasis, hoping that the
	Roc and the Sandwhip that they had found there last time
	would have killed each other off.  However, when they
	reached the ravine where the Sandwhip lived they found the
	bones of the Roc,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095089272"></a>
	and further up the
	ravine the tell-tale depression in the sand of a Sandwhip<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095089864"></a>
	in residence.  Luckily, there was a twenty foot wide area
	between the outermost reach of the Sandwhip and the wall of
	the ravine that our heroes could squeeze through before the
	sandwhip could move to grab them.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095090616" class="footnote" name="idp140274095090616"><sup class="footnote">[20]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	Heading north again, they found that the well in the next
	oasis (which had been filled with the corpses of the Lakal
	tribe the last time they passed through) had been cleared and
	cleaned.  When they reached Tuath's
	Rest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095092056"></a> it
	was obvious that their nomad friends had prospered in their
	new location.  While the party was in the south, several of
	the nomads had scouted the trails up over the Mountain
	Wall,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095092584"></a>
	and found that only the one from
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095109896"></a>
	(over which the characters had originally traveled) was
	passable by animals, and that only barely.  Five of the young
	warriors<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095110552"></a>
	
	had decided to seek fame and fortune, and the party agreed
	to take them north as they go.  The sheik of the tribe also
	mentioned that some of his warriors had seen strange
	creatures seemingly formed of shadow, and on a few occasions
	had been attacked by these creatures.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095112008"></a>
      </p><p>
	The party climbed the Mountain Wall and traveled through the
	mountains without incident, but when they entered
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095113064"></a>
	they stumbled directly into another battle amongst the local
	humanoids<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095113672"></a> but escaped without serious
	injury.  Crossing the Vale of Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095114264"></a> they were again accosted by the
	ghosts,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095114840"></a> who demanded a status report.
	When they left the Vale they were attacked by Horse
	Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095115480"></a>
	and driven into the Thornwood
	Forest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095116056"></a> where they soon stumbled into the
	clearing with the tiny hut and Mother
	Thistle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095116696"></a> They spent the night there, and
	she told them of the many changes in the North since they
	left, all bad.
      </p><p>
	When they left in the morning they found themselves on the
	North edge of the forest.  When they reached Arn's
	Ferry<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095117864"></a>
	Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095118408"></a> warned them that there had been an
	increase in disorder in Carzala and that the party's journey
	would disrupt the power structure.  Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095119080"></a> agreed to become Balour Shaw's

	Upon reaching Seagate they were ushered into the
	Count's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095123384"></a> presence, where he congratulated
	them, and restored to them their property which had been
	seized illegally by the court when they were
	exiled.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095124088"></a> He also explained that there
	had been many irregular legal aspects to their arrest, trial,
	and sentencing, and that he had reversed their sentences for
	that reason.
      </p><p>
	He rewarded them for their journey by giving each of them
	dwarven armor,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095125544"></a> and arranged a meeting of the
	major merchants<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095126120"></a> to hear about the journey and
	the prospects for trade.  At the meeting they were heckled by
	<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095126760"></a>, 
	whose low opinion of them found ready favor with
	some disgruntled members of the court, though not with the
	Count.  During the meeting a mysterious explosion in Arn's
	Ferry<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095127480"></a> was
	mentioned; it had destroyed the ancient Giant's tower where
	Balour Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095128088"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095128488"></a> lived.
	(Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095129432"></a> was
	dismayed: of what use was his apprenticeship now?)  After the
	meeting Wesved sent men to kill the party members, but the
	party dispatched the assassins with ease, and Wesved's head<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095130152"></a>
	ended on a pole when the Count<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095131000"></a> investigated his actions.
      </p><p>
	The party found that it had returned after four years to a
	country in disorder: bandits and outlaws were
	everywhere,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095132104"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095132504"></a>
	travel had become difficult,

	ruining trade with the North, smuggling had increased
	dramatically,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095133688"></a>
	drug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095134232"></a> use had
	run rampant (and not just in the cities, causing many to worry
	that the work-force of Carzala would be ruined), people were
	disappearing from cities and farms, and a group of Barons,
	including the Baron of Seagate,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095135000"></a> opposed the Count in everything
	he did.  No one was able to understand why the country had
	deteriorated so rapidly.  How had things come to this?  Had
	the gods looked on Carzala with disfavor?  Was the whole land
	cursed?

	One evening not long after their return to Seagate, the party
	was relaxing in their house<a href="#ftn.idp140274095139288" class="footnote" name="idp140274095139288"><sup class="footnote">[21]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095139704"></a>
	when one of them heard a knocking 
	on the shutter of his window.  Upon opening the window, he
	found
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095140360"></a>
	hanging from the roof.  He swung in and said that it was best
	that he was not seen with the party.  When the whole group had
	gathered, he asked them if they were interested in revenge
	against Amur Gibbetsmaster,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095141384"></a>
	the judge who forced them into the journey to the south.  They
	were, and agreed to meet
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095142040"></a>
	later in an abandoned warehouse.  He then left by the same
	route he entered.
      </p><p><a name="returningfromthedead"></a>
	At the meeting, he showed the characters papers that proved
	that the judge wanted to send a group south for his own
	purposes, and chose the party because they were convenient.
	Other papers indicated that Gibbetsmaster was involved with
	smuggling and perhaps the drug
	shipments<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095143832"></a>
	that were so devastating the cities.  Unfortunately, the
	papers were not legal proof of Gibbetsmaster's involvement,
	but they did mention a possible landing of smuggling ships,
	and the party decided to investigate that in hopes of finding
	out more.  Amazingly,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Kalo Bibkins</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095145416"></a>
	also showed up at this meeting and behaved in a very eccentric
	manner.  He offered no reason for his continued existence, and
	no one felt brave enough to ask.
      </p><p>
	Arriving at the cove where the landing was scheduled the party
	found that the ships had already arrived, and were about to be
	unloaded.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095146920"></a>
      Using stealth, distractions, and the help of the unnerving Kalo
      Bibkins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095147800"></a>
    they killed the lookouts and wiped out most of the smugglers
    before the smugglers realized what was happening.  During the
    fight a large crate was dropped on
    Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095148776"></a>
  from a cave fifty feet up a cliff, breaking most of the bones
  in her body.  One of the ships turned out to be a
  pirate<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095150088"></a>
and the other turned out to be owned directly by Amur
Gibbetsmaster;<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095150872"></a>
both were packed full of
drugs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095152104"></a>
to be smuggled into the country and had recently been fitted
with slave chains.  The ships carried papers incriminating
Gibbetsmaster in slave trading,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095153048"></a>
drug running, and smuggling valuable goods out of the country.
Three hidden caves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095153928"></a>
on the cliff side turned out to be full of smuggled goods.
      </p><p>
	Following leads from the few surviving smugglers, the party
	found the two hundred slaves<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095155672"></a> Gibbetsmaster intended to
	ship out this trip, guarded by twenty-five ruffians.  The
	party freed the slaves and returned to Seagate to inform the
	Count of Gibbetsmaster's treachery, having left the uncanny
	Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095156440"></a> to
	guard the ships.  On the way they were attacked by a group of
	ruffians roused by a guard who had escaped the slave coffle,
	but the party survived the attack and wiped out the ruffians,
	leaving no one to warn Gibbetsmaster.

	Upon reaching Seagate they immediately warned the Count of
	Amur Gibbetsmaster's perfidy.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095160152"></a> The count asked them to
	discretely abduct Amur Gibbetsmaster from the Baron of
	Seagate's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095160792"></a> country castle.  He hoped to
	prevent the civil war that would undoubtedly result if the
	Count were to ask for Gibbetsmaster's head and the Baron were
	to refuse.
      </p><p>
	The characters' succeeded, much to everybody's surprise, and
	brought Gibbetsmaster to justice in Seagate, where he was 
	interrogated by the Count's chief Mage.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095162072"></a>
	It was revealed that he was part of a conspiracy<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095162680"></a>
	to weaken
	the count and had been for several years.  Unfortunately, he
	did not reveal the names of any of the other leaders,
	although he did reveal that the conspiracy was led by a
	powerful mage, and listed many of the landing places of the
	smugglers and pirates<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095163480"></a>
	and his contacts with them.  Amur
	Gibbetsmaster died after making a signed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095164088"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095165160"></a>

	The characters were greatly rewarded for their services.
	First they were given the captured ships and cargo.  Next
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095167624"></a>
	and Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095168168"></a>
	were pardoned<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095168712"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095169384"></a> for any crimes they might have
	committed in the past.  Finally the party was
	given<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095170280"></a>
	Korsepolis, the Vale of Morin, and the Mountain Wall to hold,
	clean of danger, and rebuild for trade with the south, as a
	new barony.  This
	latter proved especially unpopular with some of the court, who
	were sure they were more deserving and better fitted for this

	and its aftermath,
	the party returned to the cove to claim the ships, which the
	Count had awarded them.  The Count sent along a crew for
	each ship and a few marines to help and to make sure that all
	the deadly drugs were destroyed (and to make sure he got his
	eight percent of the treasure).  When the party started
	taking goods out of the caves they were attacked by a
	Phantasm in each cave.  Later they were attacked by huge
	spiders,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095177736"></a>
	which captured several of the crew and Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095178312"></a>

	The spiders retreated into

	ends of the smugglers' caves and the party followed, leaving
	the majority of the marines and crew to continue loading the
	ships.
      </p><p> 
	These tunnels led to a huge maze of crooked tunnels, infested
	by spiders and other strange creatures.  The party rescued
	some of the captured marines and sailors, along with two
	halflings<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095181912"></a> and a massive, grey, otherworldly
	being (Evan),<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095182536"></a>
	but the others had been taken to a huge circular room of
	worship.  This room was dominated by ever changing views of
	other places on the walls, an altar where the spiders where
	sacrificing their captives, and a gigantic demonic spider
	whose limbs spanned the room.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095183336"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095183752"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095184152"></a> Most of the prisoners were
	freed in the ensuing battle, but the walls of the room kept
	fading in and out, and one of the marines stumbled into one of
	the scenes on the wall and vanished.  Ominously, the altar was

	The party returned to Seagate from Smugglers'
	Cove<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095191896"></a>
	with two ships loaded with treasure.  Once there they
	investigated selling the non-drug portion of the cargo in
	Carzala (the Count<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095192568"></a> had forbidden them to sell the
	drugs in Carzala).  After talking with several merchants,
	including Vlad Sharp-knife,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095193240"></a> they decided to keep the
	ships and to start their own merchant company.  They hired
	crews and officers and so forth and started the company, with
	Winther and Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095193960"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095194360"></a>
	taking the lead in keeping track of all the details, and Vlad
	Sharp-knife providing occasional consulting.  After
	Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095195016"></a>
	recovered she began taking a great deal of interest in the
	business.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095195624"></a> They sold the non-lethal
	drugs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095196488"></a> in the
	North, against the wishes and vehement protests of
	Winther,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095197096"></a> but
	to the great enrichment of the party.
      </p><p>
	Gim made a trip to Arn's Ferry,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095198120"></a> where he discovered that
	Ilene,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095198696"></a> young
	woman whom the party rescued from the Force Dome in Sassym's
	Stronghold,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095199320"></a> was rebuilding Balour Shaw's
	tower with the help of some
	Dwarves.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095199944"></a> She
	had been away at the time of the explosion and believed Balour
	Shaw dead when she heard of it.  Back in Seagate,
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095200600"></a>
	visited the Count's archives, and discovered that the tower
	was standing when Carzala was settled by humans, and inhabited
	then as well.
      </p><p>
	The party went to Dhairrhuwyth,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095201720"></a>
	a local mage, to get some
	magic items identified.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095202312" class="footnote" name="idp140274095202312"><sup class="footnote">[24]</sup></a>
      The mage turned out to have known Balour Shaw, and had been
      investigating the explosion of Balour Shaw's tower.  He had
      found out that a single gold coin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095203304"></a> with a eight-pointed star was
      found on top the rubble, that Balour Shaw had killed three
      assassins carrying similar coins several years ago when the
      assassins were after a party of adventurers, and that one of
      the major symbols of the
      Arkanian<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095204136"></a>
      cult is an eight-pointed
      star.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095204712"></a> He asked the party to accompany him

	The festival at Finn's Waste<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095208296"></a> turned out to be impressive,
	bringing thousands of worshipers from all over Carzala, and
	much of the preaching called on the worshipers to be ready to
	bring unbelievers to Arkan's Throne<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095209016"></a> to be judged, on the coming Day
	of the Rule of Arkan.  The festival took place around a huge
	monolith, carved at the top in the shape of a godly head.  The
	party observed that there were caves hidden inside the
	monolith, and snuck inside under cover of invisibility.
      </p><p> 
	Inside the monolith they found the true center of Arkanian
	worship and discovered it revolved around human
	sacrifice<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095210344"></a> and demonic
	worship.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095210920"></a> In the main temple were two huge
	and unsettling paintings, one of which the characters
	recognized as the view from the Entrance to
	Makad-al-Arakan,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095211624"></a>
	the World of the Arakanisi and the other of which they
	recognized as the Hall of the Great
	Spider<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095212264"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095212680"></a> from the caves behind the
	Smugglers' Cove.  While sneaking about the party overheard a
	discussion linking the Arkanians to the conspiracy of Amur
	Gibbetsmaster and the death of Balour
	Shaw.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095213416"></a>
	They went on to disrupt a ritual intended to call up Arakan,
	during which they killed a few devils, and rescued some prisoners
	intended for sacrifice.  One of the prisoners turned out to be
	Gerrod,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095214152"></a> the
	marine who vanished from the Spider Hall.  On their way out
	the party collapsed the access tunnel to the complex under the
	monolith.  Returning to Seagate, they reported to the
	Count,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095214888"></a> who sent out troops to capture the
	Arkanians left at Finn's Waste and slapped stiff restrictions
	on the other Arkanians in the County.
      </p><p>
	Knowing the party will have other things to do,
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095216040"></a> and
	Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095216584"></a>
	agreed to subcontract the exploration of an alternate route to
	the Vale of Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095217208"></a> to a group of adventures calling
	themselves BAMF,
	Inc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095217800"></a> The count
	retired Gerrod<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095218360"></a>
	into the party's service at his request, where he quickly
	became an indispensable `butler'.

	(This scenario was Gamesmastered by
	N. Alan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095221880"></a>
	Bond.)  During the night of the first day of this scenario,
	the characters were awakened by a loud rapping on their
	bedroom doors and the snooty voice of Elbain the
	Small<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095222584"></a> telling our heroes to gather in
	their common room.  There the adventures met Amlach the
	Golden<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095223240"></a> who represented the
	Yester.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095223816"></a> After
	Amlach offered a job and a reasonable price for the party's
	services, the adventurers agreed to undertake the offered
	mission.  The next morning, our heroes set out on a ship
	provided by the Yester which traveled from Seagate to
	Swithan's Cove.  After departing from the boat with the Yester
	Rabon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095224664"></a> as their
	guide, the party traveled across the Plain of Desai to a point
	in the Southern Palisades.
      </p><p>
	From here the party traveled into the heart of the mountains.
	Rabon guided the party along a trail that was badly
	deteriorated, but had recently seen some use.  On the second
	day of travel in the mountains, the party spotted a sentinel
	fleeing along the trail.  The sentinel escaped from the
	party's partial attempt at pursuit.  With the Arkons so
	warned, the party was ambushed <span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span>.
	(The second ambush occurred after the party allowed a prisoner
	to scream during a tortu... ah interrogation session.  The
	party was saved during the ambushes by
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095226664"></a>
	Torson's brilliant fighting technique, of course.)  After
	dealing with the ambushes the party found the Cathedral.
      </p><p>
	When darkness fell, Jamie and
	Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095227752"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095228152"></a> eliminated the sentinels on the
	keep's walls which allowed the party to enter the keep and
	ascend to the stairs to the cathedral, with
	Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095228824"></a> Torson
	covering the advance of the party with his powerful magics.
	Our heroes were thus able to gain entrance to the cathedral
	and close the portculius with a few encounters with the enemy.
	After a short rest, Rabon took a small magical
	<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">boomb</span>”</span><a href="#ftn.idp140274095229880" class="footnote" name="idp140274095229880"><sup class="footnote">[25]</sup></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095230584"></a>
	from his pack and planted it next to the entrance of the
	tunnel.  The party then followed the corkscrew tunnel into the
	darkness, pausing only to deposit more of Rabon's <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">boombs</span>”</span>.
	At the bottom of the tunnel, the party met the eternal
	champion and Rabon reclaimed the sword the champion carried.
	Through here the party traveled through a downshaft to the
	private chambers of the Elite.  Here the party planted more
	bombs, found treasure, and harassed a disembodied voice with
	slight telekinetic powers.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095232024"></a>
      </p><p>
	During their search through the Elite's chambers, the party
	discovered a secret exit which they followed to a cave that
	led to the sea.  Rabon activated his bombs and the party then
	sailed in a small boat back to Swithan's Cove and rejoined the
	ship of the Yester which took them back to Seagate.

	BAMF, Inc. finally returned to Seagate from their exploration
	of the route through the mountains, with a
	report (see <a class="xref" href="#bamf-inc-report" title="Appendix A. Report from BAMF, Inc.">Appendix A, <i>Report from BAMF, Inc.</i></a>)
	of the route, a rough map, and three Auhaami bearing a message
	from the sheik at Tuath's Rest.  BAMF,
	Inc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095236840"></a> traveled
	through the mountains, picking up a old spellcasting
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095237448"></a>
	along the way.  While they were crossing the Vale of
	Morin,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095238312"></a>
	they were stopped twice by ghosts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095238888"></a> asking about the
	re-establishment of the trade routes.  In
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095239512"></a>
	they had to sneak through the continuing war between the
	orcs and the hobgoblins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095240136"></a> but found out that
	the humanoids were building crude forts and towers there.
	They finally reached the Giant's Watchtower at the edge of the
	Mountain Wall, where they found a number of
	Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095240904"></a>
	camped.  When the Auhaami learned for whom BAMF, Inc. was
	working, three of them<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095241528"></a>
	
	decided to accompany BAMF, Inc. on the return journey.
      </p><p>
	On the return trip, they traveled through the plains, where
	they were attacked by Horse Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095243368"></a> and forced into the Thornwood
	Forest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095243944"></a> where they were found by an old
	woman living in a small hut, who said they could call her
	Mother Thistle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095244600"></a> She and the hermit healed the
	injured, bickering viciously all the while.  When the party
	reached the Brastor Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095245256"></a> the old hermit left them.
      </p><p><a name="auhaamiAngbar"></a>
	The Auhaami reported that the road from the Mountain
	Wall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095246792"></a> to
	Angbar<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095247320"></a> was
	better than the
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095247896"></a>
	road<a href="#ftn.idp140274095248440" class="footnote" name="idp140274095248440"><sup class="footnote">[26]</sup></a>
      
      (though the trail down the cliff was worse), that the castle
      in Angbar was only partially in ruins, and the Gatar
      Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095250392"></a>
      terminus of the Angbar road was farther from
      Sumaldi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095250920"></a>
      which was important because
      Batik-al-Yazum<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095251512"></a>
      was increasing the number of his servants, both alive and
      undead, and had been raiding the nearby nomad tribes.  They
      also reported that a nomad from the Southern Desert reached
      them with tales of mass murders in Akhisar, in the fashion of
      the followers of Arakan.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095252344"></a>
      </p><p>
	The characters were invited to meet with a group of merchants
	on 9 Sawtes 848 to discuss opening trade with the
	South.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095253400"></a> At the meeting they discussed
	the characters' plans for the trade route and what needs to be
	done. All the merchants seemed very interested, and perhaps
	even willing to help defray the costs of opening the route.
	They invited the party back for another meeting on 25 Sawtes
	848.
      </p><p>
	On 15 Sawtes 848 as the characters were walking back from a
	restaurant, a young man burst out of one of the expensive
	homes along the street, yelling for help and saying someone
	has just abducted his father and brother.  The characters
	recognized him as the son of
	Tyrrell,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095254920"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095255592"></a> one
	of the merchants at the meeting, and approached him, but he
	fell to the ground and died, a crossbow bolt in his back.
	Entering the house, they found and killed one of the
	kidnappers and discovered a hidden passage leading to the
	sewers.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095256648"></a>
      </p><p>
	Following the trail through the sewers, they discovered
	beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095257640"></a> in
	the sewers, and then a city beneath even the sewers, inhabited
	by a race of rat-like humanoids called skaven by the
	beggars.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095258312"></a> Some
	of these humanoids had captured humans and used them as
	sacrifices in their unholy worship, at which they were joined
	by some depraved humans.  The party rescued the captives and
	escaped into the sewers, collapsing the tunnel to the
	Undercity behind them.
      </p><p>
	One of the captives turned out to be Balour
	Shaw!<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095259576"></a>
	Alas, he was incoherent most of the time, and it was clear he
	had been driven insane and could not remember any of his
	previous life.  The party decided they owed him enough that
	they would try to get him healed.
      </p><p>
	At the second meeting with the merchants all went
	well,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095260792"></a> with the merchants agreeing to
	contribute to the building of the road through the Atrusian
	hills, in return for reduced taxes on the goods that pass
	through the party's barony.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095261528"></a>
      </p><p>
	On 2 Patluf 849 the count summoned the characters to discuss
	their plans for their barony; the count offered to retire some
	of his soldiers to the area to provide it with a core
	population.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095263176"></a> He also contracted with the party
	to take a ton of silver to the south and exchange it for gold,
	which the exchange rate would make very profitable.

	  Most of the characters were out walking late one very foggy
	  evening, looking for a their favorite late-night tavern.
	  They entered the Little Bazaar, which was oddly clear of the
	  thick fog elsewhere omnipresent, when suddenly a familiar
	  voice yelled out for them to stop.  When they do, they heard
	  their own voices coming out of the fog.  The voices
	  harranged them for their past deeds, and warned them that
	  now they must be punished.  Cormac<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095271256"></a> was offered a chance to join
	  them, and
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095271864"></a> was
	  warned that he was selected out for eternal torment.  Then a
	  duplicate of each of the characters stepped out of the fog.
	  After a difficult fight they killed all of the duplicates
	  (at least, they <span class="emphasis"><em>thought</em></span> they killed the
	  duplicates...), but then the fog itself attacked them, and
	  proved impervious to their weapons.  (How do you fight
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>fog</em></span>?)
	</p><p>
	  Noticing that the fog thinned the further from the ground one
	  went, they climbed up to the roof tops above the fog, which
	  they found to be concentrated in a circle around the bazaar.
	  The fog went berserk and began destroying buildings and
	  killing anything in its path.  They noticed a thick cord of
	  silvery mist that led away from the fog, and followed it
	  back to a warehouse.
	</p><p>
	  Inside the warehouse were several hundred Arkanian
	  worshipers, kneeling and chanting, led by several priests.
	  From their bodies rose a haze that solidified into fog above
	  them and then twined into the silvery fog cord that the
	  party had followed to the building.  Outside,
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095275080"></a>
	  drew the remains of
	  Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095275656"></a>
	  (which he had carefully, perhaps obsessively, carried with
	  him since it was broken) and cut the silvery cord of fog.
	  Narung sucked magical energy from the cord, and there was a
	  huge explosion and an earthquake; ninety percent of the
	  worshipers were killed and Basgoot was knocked unconscious.
	  (Again.)  The party observed that the stump of Narung was
	  noticeably longer than before.  
	</p><p>
	  The party returned to the Bazaar where they disposed of the
	  bodies of their assailants in magical fire in a well, and
	  then returned to their house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095277528"></a> where they found that the
	  characters who had remained there had also been attacked.
	  Later the party learned that several members of the Court
	  were in the warehouse when it collapsed, and that the
	  warehouse was owned by Suliman
	  Trade.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095278312"></a>

	  Balour Shaw's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095282056"></a> amnesia and madness continued,
	  and he had to be constantly looked after, a task made more
	  difficult by the spells he randomly cast.  Late one evening
	  he was more unsettled than usual, but finally was calmed
	  down by staring into the fire, a pastime he greatly enjoyed.
	  (Ah, how the mighty are fallen.)  Suddenly he yelled, threw
	  something into the fire, and peered closely into the fire;
	  whatever he saw frightened him and he jumped back screaming,
	  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Come on, come on!  We've got to see the Wizard!</span>”</span>
	</p><p>
	  Shaw led the party on a wild goose chase through the streets
	  of Seagate and then through the
	  sewers,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095283992"></a> half
	  of the time giggling and laughing and half of the time
	  screaming something about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">idiots</span>”</span>.  They followed him
	  through the sewers till long after dark, picking up
	  Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095285112"></a>
	  Bibkins on the way, until they finally caught up to him.
	  Shaw pointed them to a secret door that disclosed a trapped
	  tunnel leading into what was obviously an abandoned mage's
	  workroom.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095285848"></a>
	</p><p>
	  Once in the room a spell was tripped, and it was magically
	  sealed, trapping the party.  In the center of the room was a
	  shimmering dome, which turned out to contain a
	  demon,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095286968"></a> and
	  when the party investigated they found that the dome was
	  about to collapse.  Luckily the demon was also inside a
	  pentagram that would hold it for a while longer, but when
	  the characters figured out how to banish the demon they
	  found that the tools they needed were inside the pentagram
	  with the demon.  They planned carefully, and when the dome
	  collapsed Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095287896"></a> Torson rushed out and pitched
	  the tools to those outside the pentagram.  Unfortunately,
	  the demon caught Gim by the leg, and proceeded to chew it
	  off.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095288600"></a> An attack by the other characters
	  distracted him long enough for Gim to break free, and they
	  were able to perform the banishment.
	</p><p>
	  Afterwards, they eventually figured out how to get out of
	  the room, and traversed a secret door upward to another
	  chamber and then exited to the cellar of a house,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095290120"></a> which
	  turned out to be a slum area.  They fled the area, dragging
	  the injured with them.

	  collapsed, and his condition continued to worsen.

	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095303672"></a>
	  healed, meeting Karl Bluetooth (an unsavory wilderness
	  guide) and lots of wolves along the way.
	</p><p>
	  Once there they found that
	  Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095304744"></a>
	  was a necromancer as well as healer, and probably undead as
	  well.  His price for healing Gim and Balour Shaw and telling
	  each of the characters something of great value was <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a
	  month of their lives.</span>”</span> Some halfhearted haggling ensued,
	  but they finally agreed with the proviso that they would
	  also receive a five point powerstone. The next morning they
	  woke to find Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095306072"></a> and Balour
	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095306632"></a>
	  were healed, though Balour Shaw was still asleep, and notes
	  written in their own handwriting placed beside them.  When
	  they got back to civilization they found out that a month
	  had passed.  The evening before they reached Seagate Balour
	  Shaw awoke, told them they had imperiled their souls by
	  dealing with
	  Mordraug,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095307512"></a>
	  were stupid for bringing him back to Seagate, and that they
	  had to protect Carzala now, he had more important things to
	  do.  
	</p><p>
	  They returned to Seagate to found out that that their house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095308984"></a>
	  had been blown up and burned down in their absence and those
	  they had left behind were nowhere to be found.

	    During this adventure Mordraug gave Gim, Cormac, Jamie,

	  After they find their exploded house,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095314920"></a> a squad of the count's
	  guards marched up to take them to the count.  Just a few
	  minutes behind them came a group of the Baron of Seagate's
	  city guards; there was a tense standoff for a few moments, but
	  eventually the city guard backed down, and off the party
	  went to see the count.
	</p><p>
	  The count was infuriated with
	  them:<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095316184"></a> there had been too many violent
	  events lately around the party, including attempts to burn
	  their ships (which did burn a nearby wharf), etc.  Local
	  opinion blamed the party for many of the other recent
	  troubles, so the count gave the party an ultimatum: in four
	  weeks they had to be out of Seagate and Carzala, and they
	  could not return until the count was no longer angry with
	  them and mood of the city had turned in their favor
	  again.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095317192" class="footnote" name="idp140274095317192"><sup class="footnote">[27]</sup></a>
	  After being told this they were ushered from the Castle by
	  the guards.
	</p><p>
	  After the guards left, they heard
	  Derenedeth's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095319208"></a>
	  voice coming from a nearby sewer entrance.  He directed them
	  to stable their horses at a livery stable where he would
	  meet them.  From there he leds them through the
	  sewers,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095319928"></a>
	  where they were followed by a small shadow that turned out,
	  eventually, to be Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095320552"></a> Bibkins.  Along the way they
	  were trapped between
	  beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095321160"></a>
	  driving giant rats for dinner and Skaven coming to fight for
	  their brethren.  They turned themselves invisible, hid in a
	  side passage, collapsed part of the tunnel on the skaven and
	  beggars, and in the ensuing confusion they escaped.
	</p><p>
	  Eventually they got to the the mage's
	  workroom<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095322392"></a> under the city where the
	  party had fought the imprisoned demon.  There the returning
	  characters found the rest of the characters, who were very
	  confused when asked what was going on, for the returning
	  characters had warned the other characters to leave the
	  house <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the explosion,<a href="#ftn.idp140274095323640" class="footnote" name="idp140274095323640"><sup class="footnote">[28]</sup></a>
	  and they have been hiding in the
	  sewers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095324568"></a> since
	  then.  The party decided to buy the
	  house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095325160"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095326104"></a> above the workroom so they
	  would have a bolt-hole in times of trouble.  They stayed at
	  a good inn for the rest of the month they were in Seagate.

	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095327480"></a>

	  retired to the lab and produced stinks and

	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095335768"></a>
	  fled Seagate on the morning of 23 Ubard 849 in the company
	  of Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095336376"></a> and an
	  unknown dwarf.  This was the morning the party was scheduled
	  to discuss plans with the count.  The party only knew that
	  Basgoot and Evan had disappeared until after the meeting
	  when
	  Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095337128"></a>
	  reported with the news.  Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095337704"></a> visited his contacts in

	  chased Basgoot, Evan, and

	  to Mordraug's Lair,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095345544"></a> where Basgoot, Bolg, and
	  Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095346104"></a>
	  reforged
	  Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095346616"></a>
	  
	  with the help of an unknown wizard/swordsmith.
	  
	  As part of the process, Narung's
	  demon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095347976"></a> was
	  released from the sword and the party had to keep it away
	  from the sorcerers while they cast the spell to reimprisoned
	  it.  To do this the characters flew around a lot until
	  Basgoot with everyone's help impaled the Demon in the eye
	  with Narung as sorcerers finished casting the spell.
	</p><p>
	  When Basgoot impaled the Demon and the sorcerers finished
	  the spell the Demon screamed so loud it knocked everyone
	  down and then was sucked into Narung.  Basgoot hesitated a
	  moment then chopped Mordraug's head off.
	  Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095349432"></a>gave off a
	  fiendish, joyous laugh and immediately attacked Basgoot,
	  struggling with him for Narung and nearly killed the
	  Demon-torn warrior.  Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095350104"></a> <span class="emphasis"><em>Entombed</em></span>
	  Bolg, and Jamie,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095351000"></a> thinking quickly, got five
	  fingers cut off (three on one hand, two on the other) but
	  prevented Narung from being <span class="emphasis"><em>Entombed</em></span>
	  with Bolg. Luckily,
	  Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095352072"></a>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Restored</em></span> them, although Jamie would not
	  be able to use them for a month.
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095352968"></a>
	  became more nearly normal in
	  appearance,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095353528"></a>
	  though he still had Narung.  The party fled Mordraug's
	  Lair<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095354376"></a> as it collapsed around them.
	  Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095354936"></a> left the
	  party soon thereafter (in disgust?) and wandered south
	  through the mountains.  The party made it back to Seagate
	  and had to leave the very next day, 10 Silemore 849, on the
	  first day of their temporary exile.

	  On the morning the party was to leave Seagate,
	  Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095359752"></a> turned up
	  terribly injured (almost dead) at the inn where the party
	  was staying.  The rest of the party healed him and when he
	  recovered he told them he'd been taking care of business
	  when he'd gotten careless and had been captured by the
	  Beggar King's minions.  The party went back to sleep.  When
	  they got up again to leave, they heard the cook telling the
	  innkeeper how ten dead beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095360984"></a> had
	  been found floating out of the sewers so far that morning.
	  The party decided to skip breakfast and leave right away.
	</p><p>
	  They reached the South Lending<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095362328"></a> in the Brastor
	  Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095362840"></a> on 25 Silemore 849, where they
	  intended to wait for the
	  mercenaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095363432"></a>
	  and
	  engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095364200"></a>
	  to arrive (except for Remy Gill,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095365016"></a> who was already with them).  As
	  soon as they rode into town, however, many of the town's
	  merchants accosted Jamie Molson<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095365656"></a> and demanded the money
	  he owed them.  After much arguing Jamie and the party
	  managed to convince the merchants (helped by Jamie's lack of
	  scaring and his pleasant facial expression) that the Jamie
	  Molson who owed them money was an
	  imposter<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095366680"></a> posing as the real Jamie
	  Molson.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095367496" class="footnote" name="idp140274095367496"><sup class="footnote">[30]</sup></a> After yet more argument the local
	  constable was also convinced, though still suspicious.
	  Unfortunately for Jamie, the
	  innkeeper<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095368392"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095369032"></a> wasn't convinced until
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> he beat Jamie about with a piece
	  of firewood.
	</p><p>
	  The first night they were in the South Lending they set a
	  watch and <span class="emphasis"><em>Magelock</em></span>ed their windows,
	  fearing that Jamie's double was after him again.  Alas, they
	  were all cast into an enchanted sleep and Jamie was
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span>ed<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095371624"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095372264"></a> away from them.
	  The <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span> woke them up, however, and
	  they immediately began looking for Jamie using
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Seeker</em></span>.  They found that he was about a
	  half a mile away, on the other side of town, and set out for
	  there immediately.
	</p><p>
	  Jamie,<a href="#ftn.idp140274095374440" class="footnote" name="idp140274095374440"><sup class="footnote">[31]</sup></a>
	on the other hand, found himself in a dead-end alley facing
	two figures — one his double and the other a demonic
	creature spitting fire.  He attempted to
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport</em></span> back to the inn room, but a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Teleport Shield</em></span> prevented it.  He then
	cleverly <span class="emphasis"><em>Teleported</em></span>ed behind the two to
	attack them from behind, but was never-the-less overpowered
	and captured.
	</p><p>
	  When the rest of the party arrived they found a number of
	  burned spots and some blood on the ground.  Upon again
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Seek</em></span>ing Jamie they got an
	  image<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095377944"></a> of him lashed over the back of
	  a demonic creature and behind him seated his double, who was
	  laughing manaicly and periodically digging at Jamie with his
	  dagger as they traveled through a hellish landscape.  The
	  landscape seemed familiar to Basgoot from his dreams...
	</p><p> The party gave up hope for Jamie and moped around the
	South Lending until the mercenaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095379512"></a> and engineers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095380328"></a> arrived to
	survey the road.  When the survey mission reached Blackstone
	Chapel<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095381224"></a> they found that several
	important factions in the order opposed the building of the
	road, worried about losing the isolation necessary to a
	religious order and the possibility of conflict with the
	savage hill tribes.  Indeed, some of the Chapel elders went
	so far as to threaten legal proceedings to block the road,
	with some apparent legal justification.  The elders agreed
	to let the road be built after the party surveyed an
	alternate route for the road that did not pass through the
	middle of the Chapel complex and the party was convinced to
	build a wayhouse<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095382344"></a>
	(at a probable cost of 100,000 to 200,000 farthings) for the
	order at the intersection of the new road and the old.
	</p><p> Some miles past the Chapel they found the
	ruins<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095383768"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095384456"></a> of what could have been an inn
	or manor house set back a bit from the road.  This could be
	repaired, though only partial walls remain now.  They did
	not find anything unusual about the ruins.  Some days past
	the ruins the party noticed they were being watched by a
	group of tribesmen.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095385560"></a> The
	characters approached the tribesmen, who all had a design
	worked into their clothes with blue-dyed leather.  The
	tribesmen communicated with the party with sign, asking what
	they were doing there.  The party managed to convey
	something of their purpose, and though the tribesmen were
	displeased, they seemed resigned.  They also seemed to
	indicate that hostile tribes lay futher along the party's
	path.
	</p><p>
	  Several days later the party was
	  attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095387000"></a> by a
	  couple of hundred tribesmen, who ambushed them in a narrow
	  valley walled with trees and thick underbush.  Even though
	  the party was ambushed, Orm and his troops and the
	  characters easily managed to defeat the tribesmen, having
	  only 3 dead and 3 severly injured, while many tribesmen
	  died.  All of the tribesmen were found to have an irregular
	  eight-pointed figure worked into their clothing with
	  red-dyed leather.
	</p><p>
	  Further along in the bending south of the road's path, the
	  party followed a disturbance into the brush one night
	  because they saw Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095388808"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095389480"></a> (who had stayed behind in
	  Seagate to manage the business) running towards them, but
	  before they could reach her she had been pulled into the
	  bushes.  When they reached the area she was gone.
	</p><p>
	  Tracks of unusually small humanoids lead away and the party
	  followed them to the foot of a tall crag, where the trail
	  ended.  Gim <span class="emphasis"><em>Walked on Air</em></span> to the top of the
	  crag, but saw only the ruins of a
	  castle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095391496"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095392184"></a>  Remy and Shay investigated
	  inside the rock of the crag, but found nothing.  After much
	  searching about, Derenedeth cast <span class="emphasis"><em>Flight</em></span>
	  on four of the party and they carried the other party
	  members to the top of the crag, where they saw the castle
	  ruins, but this time there was an intact tower!  Gim
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Bird Control</em></span>ed the giant owls nesting
	  on the top of the tower away, and the party landed and
	  entered the tower.
	</p><p>
	  The tower was filled with many strange things, including
	  invisible servants, golem
	  guardians,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095394728"></a>
	  macabre decorations, and all the modern
	  conveniences.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095395320"></a> In a room floored by a
	  huge five-pointed star in a circle the party was attacked by
	  five golems after a fireball dropped out of the ceiling and
	  exploded in the middle of the room.  In the throne room they
	  were attacked by 20 demons while another demon carried Tesla
	  down the stairs to the basement.  The surviving demons
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Blink</em></span>ed out down the stairs when the
	  party had slaughtered most of them, and the corpses revealed
	  that they had actually been short humanoids.  The party
	  recognized them as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Little People</span>”</span> of
	  BAMF's report.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095397240"></a>
	</p><p>
	  When they tried to follow they ended up on an endless stair
	  trap<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095398248"></a>
	  that finally led them to the roof where they now found an
	  observatory and an
	  orrery,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095398872"></a>
	  which when pushed caused the stars to whirl violently,
	  making all of the party terribly ill.  Going back down to
	  the basement they found it completely filled with what they
	  thought was water but what was actually a Sucking Reek that
	  turned Gim into a <span class="emphasis"><em>Body of Air</em></span>, sucked
	  him in and nearly dissolved him.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095400120"></a> After returning to
	  the throne room for much discussion, they tried the basement
	  again and this time it was dry-floored and contained a
	  steeply inclined tunnel that lead down through the crag.
	</p><p>
	  At the bottom of the crag they found an arid
	  plane<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095401592"></a> of dust-filled winds and
	  sand and gravel and baked clay, littered with various body
	  parts.  Over them a huge blood-red sun visibly rose in the
	  west, and all around were crags and huge piles of boulders.
	  They heard distant screams and Gim remembered legends of
	  such an infernal place.  They followed some tracks to a
	  crack in the bottom of another crag, which lead into a
	  series of passageways resembling nothing so much as the
	  digestive system of some huge subterranean
	  beast.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095402648"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095403048"></a> Disoriented by the foul air and
	  the nature of the passageways they stumbled through a
	  central chamber with six exits and out another tunnel.
	</p><p>
	  This tunnel eventually turned to stone and led to a set of
	  double doors.  When they opened the doors they were looking
	  upon a huge semi-spherical room with a number of statues, a
	  five-pointed star in a circle containing a dismembered body,
	  a blood-covered figure rising from the floor, and
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Jamie</em></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095404728"></a> tied to one of the statues.
	  They recognized the figure as the
	  mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095405608"></a> who
	  threatened them in Suliman
	  Trade's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095406184"></a> warehouse during the Crypts of
	  Stonesboro adventure, and <span class="emphasis"><em>he</em></span> recognized
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>them!</em></span> The party immediately began a
	  desperate attack to cover Basgoot's attempt to rescue Jamie.
	  After <span class="emphasis"><em>Haste</em></span>ing himself, Basgoot ran out
	  and slashed Jamie free from the statue with Narung, slicing
	  him slightly in the process, then ran back to the double
	  doors.  While this was going on the others were trying to
	  cast spells (which all fizzled out), keep open the slowly
	  closing double doors, and endure the attacks of fire and ice
	  triggered by the mage.  They managed to keep the doors open
	  until Basgoot had dragged Jamie through (Cormac
	  losing<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095408568"></a> the last joint of the
	  little finger on his right hand as the doors closed) and
	  then fled back up the passage under a hail of ice-daggers
	  and fireballs.
	</p><p>
	  Fleeing back through the slimy tunnels, they again stumbled through
	  the central chamber and took another tunnel.  This one eventually
	  turned to packed earth, which started collapsing about them as they
	  squirmed through.  Several of the party got stuck in the collapsing
	  tunnel, but the others managed to pull them out, into the bottom of a
	  pit, above which was a beautiful blue sky.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095410376" class="footnote" name="idp140274095410376"><sup class="footnote">[32]</sup></a>

	  The session began with the characters at the bottom of a
	  pit, staring at a wonderful blue sky above them.  Upon
	  investigating, they found that the pit was surrounded by
	  tall poles surmounted by skulls and short, painted wands
	  tasselled with feather or furs.  Off in the distance is what
	  appears to be a tribal encampment of Horse
	  nomads.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095414696"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095415096"></a> The tunnel they came through is
	  only partially collapsed, so the characters decided to dig
	  back through, after spending some time resting and healing
	  themselves.
	</p><p>
	  They began to dig, but while they are digging they hear
	  something taunting them and cursing them; when they look up,
	  on the edge of pit is a horrible creature: a spider with a
	  3-yard leg-span and a human torso attached to the front of
	  its cephalothorax!<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095416456"></a> Needless to say, there's a lot
	  of cursing going on as part of the party stands the monster
	  off while the rest finish the digging.  They manage to flee
	  back through the tunnel without anyone being killed, though
	  some were bit.
	</p><p>
	  The characters travelled back through the tunnels (or bowels
	  as the case may be), through the central chamber, and out
	  through another tunnel.  This one eventually turned into a
	  stone tunnel that narrowed down to an 3 foot tall, 18 inch
	  wide crack, which opened into a rough-hewn corridor that
	  lead off to the right and left.  Deep, gravelly voices could
	  be heard coming from both directions, but no-one could hear
	  enough to determine what they were.  Foolhardy and brave,
	  the characters decided to sneak down the corridor to the
	  right, which lead them to a chamber full of
	  Orcs.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095418264"></a> Against the back wall of
	  the chamber was a throne of huge bones and tusks, upon which
	  sat a huge orc holding a large sceptre or mace.  All of the
	  Orcs where busily employed devouring their meal; it's
	  probably best not to inquire what was on the menu.  The
	  sounds of bones cracking under the pressure of orcish molars
	  covered whatever sounds the characters may have made during
	  their approach, and they decided that discretion was the
	  better part of valour and retreated back down the crack and
	  into the slimy, odoriferous tunnels.
	</p><p>
	  Again the characters travelled back through the passageways,
	  again through the central chamber, and again out through yet
	  another exit.  <span class="emphasis"><em>This</em></span> time they came out
	  into the night in a niche on the side of a hill, a flat
	  place with steep sides and a short cliff on the back, where
	  the tunnel entrance was.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095420504"></a> The niche overlooked a desolate
	  heath, and in the distance the characters saw a faint glow,
	  and some of them occasionally heard chanting.  They were
	  attacked by two of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Little People</span>”</span>, but soon defeated
	  them.  Looking around a bit they found some stained leather
	  bindings that looked like foot-wrappings and still had
	  traces of the slime from the tunnels.
	</p><p>
	  Since the pressence of the Little People seemed to indicate
	  a likelyhood of finding
	  Tesla,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095422584"></a> and no
	  other interesting features presented themselves, the
	  characters set off north towards the glow and the chanting.
	  Out on the heath the characters came to a barrow mound, and
	  beyond the barrow mound was a ring of standing stones, and
	  in the center of that was a three-legged dolmen.  There were
	  three fires in front of the dolmen, around which danced many
	  of the Little People, and beside one of them was a wizened
	  oldster bedecked with feathers and furs and paint,
	  sharpening a cleaver.  Atop the dolmen were four warriors,
	  and what looked suspicously like a bound human.
	</p><p>
	  Attacking the Little People.  Rescuing
	  Tesla,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095424184"></a> with lots of invisibility and
	  flying.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095425048" class="footnote" name="idp140274095425048"><sup class="footnote">[33]</sup></a> Because of his great strength, Basgoot
	  was probably the one who grabbed Tesla, although there was
	  probably someone who also helped with Tesla.  Shay Uvall
	  probably attacked the shaman and took his cleaver, and there
	  may have been others attacking the group of Little People.
	  In general, lots of hacking and slashing went on.
	</p><p>
	  Not surprisingly, the Little People were not pleased by this
	  assault on their religious rites, and pursued the characters
	  with fury, cries of rage, and sharp objects.  Luckily, the
	  characters were faster.  Not to mention largely invisible.
	  Still, it was a close race back to the tunnel
	  entrance.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095427080" class="footnote" name="idp140274095427080"><sup class="footnote">[34]</sup></a>
	</p><p>
	  The characters fled back through the Belly of the
	  Beast,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095428232"></a> for such it now seemed certain
	  it was, for as they scuttled through the depth of the slime
	  increased, jets of slime shot out of orifices in the walls,
	  the tunnels shook and quaked and quivered, seemingly in
	  agony, and a terrible deep <span class="emphasis"><em>beat</em></span>
	  reverberated throughout the the tunnels.  Things Were
	  Obviously Not Well.  Luckily, this time as they stumbled
	  through the central chamber they chose the exit that lead
	  out to the infernal desert, above which rose the castle on
	  its crag.
	</p><p>
	  Finally they reached the crag and tiredly climbed up the
	  tunnel into the castle dungeon.  After some difficulty
	  getting out of the castle due to uncertainty of the stairs
	  leading one to where one expected to go (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Didn't we just do
	  this?</span>”</span>) they managed to escape and returned to the the camp
	  with their mercenary<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095430808"></a> soldiers, and found out that they had
	  only been gone only <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> day.  They
	  continued with the survey of the road.  When they got to the
	  cliff, they had to leave their horses behind, but they
	  continued with their survey, heading down out of the
	  mountains towards the Vale of Morin.
	</p><p>
	  Jamie, troubled by the pains of his wounds and the even
	  greater pains of worries about what his double was up too,
	  was wandering about in the night and stumbled upon an badly
	  wounded orc standing over the newly killed body of another
	  orc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095432936"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095433624"></a> The remaining
	  orc attacked Jamie, but because of his wounds was easily
	  dispatched.  The Orcs had two
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Evil</em></span>-looking magic items: a Mace in the
	  form of a metal Skull and an Axe fancifully engraved with
	  the visage of a hideous demon.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095435096" class="footnote" name="idp140274095435096"><sup class="footnote">[35]</sup></a>
	</p><p>
	  The next day the outriders reported a large part of Orcs
	  very near coming quickly toward the party.  Orm quickly
	  commanded the party up onto flat spot above a extremely
	  rugged and steep hillside to await the Orcs.  About a
	  hundred orcs approached, and send out a herald to parley.
	  He demanded the return of the of their two sacred relics.
	  During the parley, another group of about a hundred orcs
	  appeared, to the anger of the first group, and they also
	  sent a herald to demand the return of
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> sacred relics.  After some
	  stalling by the party, the two groups of orcs both
	  attacked<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095437256"></a> the party, co-operating against a
	  common enemy, though obviously enemies themselves.  The
	  party was outnumbered by more than two-to-one, and these
	  Orcs were clearly better armed and armored than the
	  tribesmen had been.  Cleverly, the characters thought to
	  abduct<a href="#ftn.idp140274095438088" class="footnote" name="idp140274095438088"><sup class="footnote">[36]</sup></a> and neutralize
	  the Orc mages and leaders, which helped, and their defensive
	  location helped, but even so it was difficult battle.  The
	  party was successful, though, with the orcs fleeing the
	  battle at the end, and all the characters surviving.
	</p><p>
	  So we left our heros on the field of battle, tending their
	  wounded and wondering what it was all about.

      This chapter details some of the interesting places that the
      characters found during their adventures.
    </p><p><b>Ogres' Cave. </b>
	In their very first adventure the characters found this
	out-of-the way cave in the mountains to the east of Carzala.
	A long, winding, narrow (by ogre standards) passage leads
	down to a large room.
      </p><p><b>Turon's Cave. </b>
	While rescuing a rich merchant's mad son from the
	wilderness, the party found this cave in the bank of the
	Sweetwater river.  When the river level is high, the
	entrance to this cave is under water, but the main room is
	high enough so it is rarely submerged.
      </p><p><b>Blackstone Chapel. </b>
	An order of healing monks and nuns lives here, to the south of
	the Brastor Holding.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095457992"></a> They are basically pacifistic,
	and very fond of debate.  Their deity does the really
	difficult healing, such as resurrection.
      </p><p><b>Fire Giant's Watchtower. </b>
	At the end of the mountain road out of Korsepolis on the very
	edge of the Mountain wall overlooking the cliff and the desert
	is a tall, strong tower that was once inhabited by an evil
	Fire Giant.
      </p><p><b>Smugglers' Caves. </b>
	While investigating the doings of Amur
	Gibbetsmaster<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095461320"></a> the party discovered this
	very interesting set of caves, which led into a maze of
	tunnels inhabited by Giant Spiders and full of Arkanian
	symbols.  In front of the caves is a cove convenient for
	smugglers.

      This campaign never really ended, but the geographical dispersal
      of the players eventually caused it to sink into quiescence.
      Still, with 30 adventures over several more sessions than that,
      it lasted pretty well.  It looks like there were 5 adventures in
      1985, 15 adventures in 1986, 2 adventures in 1987, 5 adventures
      in 1988, 2 adventures in 1989, 2 adventures in 1992, and 2
      adventures in 1994.  Several of the players graduated from
      college in 1986, if I remember correctly, and left the area for
      jobs.  In the later years we played at Thanksgiving and
      Christmas, when the players returned to the area on 
      holidays.  After that things began to get too difficult to
      schedule. 
    </p><p>
      There were plenty of things left for the players to do:
      finishing the road, developing their barony,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095464680"></a> fighting humanoids
      along the Mountain Wall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095465528"></a>, trade caravans to the south,
      fighting The Mage<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095466136"></a> and The
      Necromancer<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095466696"></a>, and so forth.
    </p><p>
      I was surprised, looking back, at how many player characters,
      and how many important non-player characters, died during this
      campaign, or were severely wounded.
    </p><p>
      At some point I'd like to revisit this campaign, but frankly at
      this point in my life I'm not sure I'd be interested in doing it
      in either <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em> or
      <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em> (my tastes lately run to simpler
      rules systems), and I'm not sure converting things
      to yet another system would be worth it.  (At the time, I was
      maintaining the <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em> character sheets
      using the original <a class="link" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html" target="_top">MakeChar</a>;
      I've no idea what the modern equivalents are like.)
    </p><p>
      Of course, looking back at the box of index cards I used to keep
      NPC and monster stats I see that my typical <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095471496"></a> NPC or
      monster easily fit on the front of one index card, and are in
      general remarkably simple.  Really, <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095472424"></a>'s complexity comes
      during character creation, and then only for characters that you
      are detailing to the level of a PC, something you'd only do for
      a major villian; for everybody else you just pick the numbers
      you want.
    </p><p>
      In 2007 I revisited to this setting briefly with a
      <em class="citetitle">Savage Worlds</em> adventure for my daughter,
      niece, nephews, and one of the original players.  It was fun to
      see the original players eyes get big when he realized where
      this new adventure was taking place.  And the adventure itself
      was fun, so I reckoned it was successful on both levels.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp140274095474504"></a>9.1. <em class="citetitle">The Frontiers of Alusia</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095475176"></a></h2></div></div></div><p>
	<em class="citetitle">The Frontiers of Alusia</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095476536"></a> really was minimal, consisting of only the
	22"×24" map, a description of the general area on the
	inside of the coversheet (a thin 11"×17" sheet of thin
	cardboard, folded over to be an 8½"×11" folder), the
	map key on the back of the coversheet, and a 4 page
	<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Travel Guide for the Frontiers of Alusia Adventure
	Map</span>”</span> (an 11"×17" sheet of paper, folded over to
	be two 8½"×11" sheets, making 4 pages) with a short
	paragraph for each of the most important map
	features.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095478664" class="footnote" name="idp140274095478664"><sup class="footnote">[38]</sup></a>
      The area was a frontier, relatively recently settled (or
      resettled, as it ended up in my campaign's backhistory),
      surrounded by wilderness and strange creatures, with little
      bits of the past, ruins and such, appearing here and there.  I
      think the sparseness of the setting was actually helpful: you
      could easily know everything about the setting and could mold
      it however you wanted.
      </p><p>
	In any case, like the other campaigns featuring <em class="citetitle">The Frontiers of Alusia</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095485480"></a>
	I've since found on the net, I added many features of my own
	to the area, including a new area to the south, off the map,
	where the player characters ended up spending a significant
	portion of their time.  I also went back and forth on the size
	of the area a number of times, rescaling it to have a larger
	area and adjusting the population upwards.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp140274095486920"></a>9.2. <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095487576"></a></h2></div></div></div><p>
	I have a description of the <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095488664"></a> rules <a class="link" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/dragonquest-and-i/" target="_top">elsewhere</a>.
	I'm glad I started this out in <em class="citetitle">DragonQuest</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095490312"></a> (<em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095491096"></a>); I liked
	the <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095491896"></a> rules much more than <em class="citetitle">AD&amp;D</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095492712"></a>, as they allowed much
	more flexible and detailed characters and more interesting
	tactics, as well as allowing every character to have some
	magic.  It gave a much different feel to the campaign.  I had
	previously used <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095493720"></a> to play a moderate length campaign using
	the wonderful <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095494552"></a> adventure <em class="citetitle">The Enchanted Wood</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095495368"></a>, written by
	<span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Paul</span> <span class="surname">Jaquays</span></span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095496600"></a> and published by <span class="orgname">SPI</span><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095497416"></a>, and had been very
	pleased with how <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095498232"></a> played, and it was a good fit for the
	campaign.
      </p><p>
	  Eventually, however, I became dissatisfied with <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095499512"></a>, probably
	  due to the number of independent forumulas that I had to
	  calculate when updating major NPCs and the players had to
	  calculate when updating PCs.  
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp140274095500456"></a>9.3. <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095501112"></a></h2></div></div></div><p>
	Eventually, however, I began to want something that was even
	more flexible than <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095502248"></a>, which had few skills outside those
	explictly part of the professional skills (Alchemist,
	Mechanican, Troubadour, etc.) and the combat skills.  I also
	became dissatisfied with the many independent formulas that
	had to be calculated when updating characters.  These formulas
	were scattered through the rulebook so it was painful to find
	them and then painful to actually do the
	calculation.<a href="#ftn.idp140274095503160" class="footnote" name="idp140274095503160"><sup class="footnote">[39]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	  In some ways then it is ironic that the next system used was
	  <a class="link" href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">GURPS</em></a>
	  3<sup>rd</sup> edition, from <a class="link" href="http://www.sjgames.com/" target="_top"><span class="orgname">Steve Jackson Games</span></a>.  (See <a class="xref" href="#switchtogurps-para">Section 5.27, “Monsters and Merchants Under Seagate”</a>.)  It has lots of skills,
	  which also need to be calculated when characters gain
	  experience. However, at least in <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095508168"></a> all skills (which
	  includes magic) have costs that are figured off one table,
	  and it is the actual skill number that goes up, rather than
	  the skill rank and then some other number figured by a
	  (often) unique formula.
	</p><p>
	In any case, I converted<a href="#ftn.idp140274095509352" class="footnote" name="idp140274095509352"><sup class="footnote">[40]</sup></a>
	all the characters from <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095512488"></a> to 3<sup>rd</sup>
	edition <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095513688"></a> (they ended up around 350 points, and were
	probably a little more powerful and considerably more
	well-rounded) and important NPCs over (the chief villain of
	the campaign ended up at well over 1000 points), and the
	players were able to adjust pretty quickly.  (They were
	already used to a detailed tactical hex-grid combat system
	from <em class="citetitle">DQ</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095514824"></a>, so adapting to <em class="citetitle">GURPS</em><a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095515640"></a> wasn't that much of a
	stretch.)  All in all, it worked out very well.

      About one week ago the BAMF,
      Inc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095520472"></a> returned to
      Seagate with a report and a rough map, which they duly presented
      to the characters.  They also were accompanied by three
      Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095521160"></a>
      carrying a message from the chief at Tuath's
      Rest<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095521752"></a>.  The
      report and message follow herewith.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp140274095522600"></a>A.2. Report from BAMF, Inc.</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Until Blackstone Chapel<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095523560"></a> (twenty miles into the South
	Downs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095524152"></a>),
	the road is passable without much trouble, and suitable for
	carts and wagons, excepting a few trouble spots.  However,
	within five miles the road after the chapel has disappeared
	completely except for almost unnoticable traces.  The rangers
	were able to follow those traces without too many problems.
	Eighty miles beyond Blackstone Chapel the traces lead into a
	medium-sized valley, about 1 mile long and a quarter to half a
	mile wide.  The far end of the valley forks, dividing east and
	south.  Streams run down each of the forks into the center of
	the valley where there is a large pond.  A large stream
	empties this pool and runs out of the valley through the end
	the party entered the valley (the northwest end).  Beside the
	pool is a ruin, little more than foundation outlines and a
	pile of stones.
      </p><p>
	The party took the east fork and traveled about fifteen miles
	until they came to a tree surrounded by wolves.  In the tree
	was perched a three foot tall near-human (of an unknown race),
	which the party rescued.  It turned out he was the chief of a
	tribe, and in gratitude he invited them back to his home cave
	for a feast.  The party agreed, and accompanied them to the
	cave (were there were two hundred or so little
	people<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095526344"></a>), where they were served fine
	food and and absolutely the best ale they had ever tasted.
	However, after most of the party had nodded off they were
	attacked by the Little People.  The party bravely fought off
	the attack and managed to escape the cave complex, capturing
	the chief along the way.  The chief was killed during the
	escape, but one of the party,
	Bere<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095527256"></a> (pronounced
	bear), carried the body along and after reaching a safe place
	he cut out the
	heart<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095527896"></a>
	of the chief and ate it.  It made him sick for several days.
      </p><p>
	They travelled about fifteen more miles and came to a deep,
	swift, and fairly wide mountain streem that they found
	uncrossable.  In the middle of the stream is a large rock
	which looks as if it may have at one time supported a
	bridge<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095529400"></a>.
	This stream is also inhabited by a large monster, which the
	party glimpsed only briefly.  Though they did explore upstream
	several miles, they did not find any better places to cross,
	so they returned to the fork in the valley and took the south
	branch.
      </p><p>
	Following the south branch, they were surrounded by a
	tribe<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095530920"></a>
	of humans with stone and bronze weapons.  The party managed to
	convince the tribesmen that the party was not hostile, and
	became somewhat friendly with them.  These tribesmen mentioned
	that there were several tribes in the mountains, and that all
	the others were hostile.  They were greatly curious about the
	iron weapons of the party members, for iron weapons were only
	legends to them.
      </p><p>
	About twenty miles from the fork the party came to cliff-face.
	Only a rough footpath (not sufficient for pack animals, but
	adequate for careful climbers) is left on the cliff-face
	itself.  While they were climbing the footpath, they came
	abreast of a cave mouth, in which appeared a mad-looking old
	man yelling <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Who are you?</span>”</span> This
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095533528"></a>
	promptly fell out of the cave mouth, yelling <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Now what
	<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> that spell…</span>”</span> A little
	while later he came climbing bck up to them, covered in white
	feathers.  He tagged along with the party after that.  He did
	not know the mountains, answering the party's questions in
	that direction with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Haven't the foggiest!  I've never
	been here before in my life!</span>”</span> He did help them a couple
	of times by lighting the evening fire with a Fireball spell,
	though.  After the clif-face they descended through the
	mountains for twenty miles until they reached the Vale of
	Morin.
      </p><p>
	When the party crossed the Vale of
	Morin<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095536520"></a>
	they were accosted by
	Ghosts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095537080"></a> twice;
	both times they were asked if they were working to establish a
	trade route, the ghosts saying <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">we were promised this so
	our souls could rest.</span>”</span> The party replied that they were
	surveying for the trade route.
      </p><p>
	When the party reached
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095538664"></a>
	they found that, although the
	humanoids<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095539240"></a>
	were not having one of their frequent wars in the ruins, there
	<span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span> many of them in the surrounding
	mountains, and in the city itself.  The ruins of Korsepolis
	are nestled in the mouth of a valley, through which runs the
	road into the Mountain Wall.  The ruins completely fill the
	mouth of the valley, and a a half a mile wide or more.  In the
	center of the city is an
	area<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095540568"></a> that has been cleared of
	ruins and leveled by the humanoids.  They piled the stones
	around the cleared area, making a circular mound around it,
	and many are living in it (about 150 to 200).  Other than the
	watch around the central area, the humanoids do not seem to
	keep careful watch on the city, patrolling only once every
	three or four days or so.  In the city there are ruins of what
	must have once been a small
	fort<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095541816"></a>
	which could be rebuilt relatively easily.  It seems to be
	newer than the rest of the ruins, and was built using rubble
	frmo the city.  There are also two
	towers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095542792"></a>
	of the same sort in different areas of the city that could be
	rebuilt.  The humanoids seem to avoid these areas for some
	reason, not coming close to them on their patrols through the
	city.  After observing the city for a while BAMF sneaked
	through undetected and continued to the Watchtower.
      </p><p>
	When BAMF reached the
	Watchtower<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095544344"></a>
	they found twenty-five
	Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095544920"></a>
	camped around there.  The Watchtower itself seemed in good
	shape, and had not been entered.  The Auhaami asked who the
	party was and what it was doing, and when told it was working
	for the explorers who came through several months ago three
	Auhaami decided to accompany them back to Seagate with a
	message.
      </p><p>
	On the way back through Korsepolis the party ran into a small
	group of orcs, which they managed to destroy.  They left the
	city hurriedly before any other orcs found them.
      </p><p>
	On the return leg of the journey the party was attacked by
	Horse Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095546824"></a>
	and several people were severely injured.  While the old
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095547432"></a> held off
	the nomads with an odd assortment of spells the party
	retreated into the
	Thronewood<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095548344"></a>,
	where they were found by an old woman<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095548920"></a>.  The old woman and the old man
	healed the injured party members, while arguing constantly
	over everything while they were together.
      </p><p>
	When the party reached the Brastor Holding the old man left
	them.  The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful, except
	for several short battles with bandits along the roads in the
	Atrusian Hills<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095550184"></a>.
      </p><p>
	The total time for the journey was 83 days, but the rangers
	estimate that travel time through the South
	Downs<a class="indexterm" name="idp140274095551240"></a> and
	the East Bounders would be fifteen to sixteen days.
