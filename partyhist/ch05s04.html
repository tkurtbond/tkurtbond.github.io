<p>
	The party contracted to defend a religious community of
	healers in the hills south of the
	Brastor Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262746360"></a>
      and the South Lending.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262747176"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262747832"></a>
    The community had angered Polam
    Wesved,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262748696"></a>
  a powerful and unscrupulous merchant, by offering shelter to
  Rayesta,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262749560"></a>
a beautiful Horse Nomad warrior that Wesved had tried to
abduct and enslave.  She beat off the kidnappers, but was
severely injured; fleeing into the southern hills, she
stumbled into Blackstone Chapel, a small religious community,
where she was taken in and healed.  Wesved told the community
to return her to him, and when they refused gave them three
weeks to change their minds, threatening violence if they did
not.
      </p>
<p>
	Since they were basically pacifistic and did not have the
	skills to defend their community and Rayesta from Wesved's
	thugs, the Chapel sent one of their most trusted men,
	Tychel,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262751384"></a> to
	complain to the authorities in the South Lending.  These,
	however, told him it was out of their jurisdiction, since the
	Chapel was beyond the borders of the Brastor
	Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262752104"></a> (perhaps acting under the
	influence of Polam Wesved).  Desperate, Tychel sought out a
	group of adventurers, on his own, to bring them back to
	protect the community.  On the way to Blackstone Chapel they
	were ambushed, but most survived, and even the fatalities
	were<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262752920"></a> resurrected.<a href="#ftn.idp140214262753752" class="footnote" name="idp140214262753752"><sup class="footnote">[13]</sup></a>
      </p>
<p>
	After a furious debate, the community decided that it was
	morally permissible for them to hire the adventurers to defend
	the community.  There were several attacks, which were beaten
	off at the cost of several party members (including at least
	Gim and Cormac).<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262755784"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262756840"></a>
      However, the party
      members were resurrected<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262758104"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262759160"></a>
    by the grateful community's deity, and eventually
    <a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262760424"></a>
    gave up this approach to regaining Rayesta.
      </p>
<p>
	When they returned to the South Lending, the party was
	arrested<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262761480"></a>
      <a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262762664"></a>
      since they had been accused by Polam Wesved of
      stealing a valuable slave (Rayesta) and killing his henchmen
      who were (he claimed) in lawful pursuit of her.
      Unfortunately for Wesved, the judge whose compliance he had
      bought was replaced at the last minute by the new Laird of
      the South Lending, and the final decision was against him.
