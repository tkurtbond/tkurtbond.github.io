<p>
	The
	Thri-Kreen,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262862456"></a>
	the insectoids who had ambushed the party when they first
	ventured upon the desert, attacked the nomads in force one
	evening, carrying off fifteen men and thirty women, along with
	one-hundred thirty-seven herd beasts.  The party agreed to
	accompany the nomads on a raid to Tuath's
	Rest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262863288"></a>
	where the Thri-Kreen were living in caves in the hills, to
	recover the captives before they were eaten.
      </p>
<p>
	The party helped scout and plan the attack, and Gim Torson
	called up a storm as a distraction,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262864440"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262864840"></a> but he succeeded beyond
	his wildest dreams, and it became a race to defeat the
	Thri-Kreen and recover the prisoners before the caves in which
	they were imprisoned flooded.
	Winther,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262865576"></a> who
	summoned a fire elemental<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262866136"></a> to attack the Thri-Kreen, was
	also successful, but ended up with an intelligent,
	self-willed, and very independent, if immature and brash, fire
	elemental, who assisted in the assault only for the chaotic
	fun of it.
      </p>
<p>
	During the assault on the caves, the Thri-Kreen Queen was on
	the verge of defeating the party and the nomads with her magic
	and guards, when
	Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262867448"></a> in
	desperation surrendered himself to the control of the sword.
	The sword killed the Queen and then cracked open the mountain,
	starting an earthquake that collapsed the Thri-Kreen caves.
	Luckily, all the party and the surviving nomads escaped the
	cave-in, carrying Basgoot, who had again collapsed into
	unconsciousness.
      </p>
<p>
	Basgoot had again changed,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262868728"></a> and now had pointed
	ears, hardened talon-like nails, an inhuman look to his face,
	deep crimson skin slightly scaled, black hair, and completely
	black eyes.  He was seven feet tall, and weighed 400 pounds.
	His skin had also become incredibly tough.
      </p>
<p>
	During the attack Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262870216"></a> broke open one of the strange
	clay balls<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262870792"></a>
	from the chest they had found in the Fire
	Giant's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262871384"></a>
	Tower, releasing another of the shadow
	creatures.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262871976"></a>
      </p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	  During this adventure the party picked up fourteen
	  semi-transparent resinous jewels in nine colors.  (These
	  turned out to be ten point powerstones, and each of the
	  following people have one: Gim, Shay, Basgoot, Winter, and
	  Derendeth.)  They also got twenty semi-transparent, flexible
	  bladders full of viscous liquid in eight colors, all packed
	  into a small box of smooth, reddish, slightly grainy
	  material.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214262873992"></a>
