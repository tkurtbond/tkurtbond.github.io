<p>
	  After the chase through the sewers to the hidden magical
	  workroom imprisoning the demon, Balour
	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263177864"></a>
	  collapsed, and his condition continued to worsen.
	  Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263178472"></a>
	  stabilized Gim's leg, but could not heal it.  When they
	  looked for other healers it became apparent that none were
	  left in the city: some had died, others had been killed,
	  others had just plain disappeared.  Eventually a dwarf (one
	  of those the party had rescued from the Crypts of
	  Stonesboro) came and told them of
	  Mordraug,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263179352"></a>
	  a powerful healer who lived at the head of the Wolf
	  River,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263179960"></a>
	  in the mountains below the Sweet
	  Riding.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263180536"></a> Gim, Cormac, Jamie, Basgoot,
	  Shay Uvall, and Balour
	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263181128"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263181528"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263181944"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263182344"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263182744"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263183144"></a> went to Mordraug's
	  Lair<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263183704"></a> to get Gim and Balour
	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263184280"></a>
	  healed, meeting Karl Bluetooth (an unsavory wilderness
	  guide) and lots of wolves along the way.
	</p>
<p>
	  Once there they found that
	  Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263185352"></a>
	  was a necromancer as well as healer, and probably undead as
	  well.  His price for healing Gim and Balour Shaw and telling
	  each of the characters something of great value was <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a
	  month of their lives.</span>”</span> Some halfhearted haggling ensued,
	  but they finally agreed with the proviso that they would
	  also receive a five point powerstone. The next morning they
	  woke to find Gim<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263186680"></a> and Balour
	  Shaw<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263187240"></a>
	  were healed, though Balour Shaw was still asleep, and notes
	  written in their own handwriting placed beside them.  When
	  they got back to civilization they found out that a month
	  had passed.  The evening before they reached Seagate Balour
	  Shaw awoke, told them they had imperiled their souls by
	  dealing with
	  Mordraug,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263188120"></a>
	  were stupid for bringing him back to Seagate, and that they
	  had to protect Carzala now, he had more important things to
	  do.  
	</p>
<p>
	  They returned to Seagate to found out that that their house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263189592"></a>
	  had been blown up and burned down in their absence and those
	  they had left behind were nowhere to be found.
	</p>
<p><b>Magic. </b>
	    During this adventure Mordraug gave Gim, Cormac, Jamie,
	    Basgoot, and Shay Uvall five point
	    powerstones.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263191688"></a>

<p>
	  After they find their exploded house,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263195528"></a> a squad of the count's
	  guards marched up to take them to the count.  Just a few
	  minutes behind them came a group of the Baron of Seagate's
	  city guards; there was a tense standoff for a few moments, but
	  eventually the city guard backed down, and off the party
	  went to see the count.
	</p>
<p>
	  The count was infuriated with
	  them:<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263196792"></a> there had been too many violent
	  events lately around the party, including attempts to burn
	  their ships (which did burn a nearby wharf), etc.  Local
	  opinion blamed the party for many of the other recent
	  troubles, so the count gave the party an ultimatum: in four
	  weeks they had to be out of Seagate and Carzala, and they
	  could not return until the count was no longer angry with
	  them and mood of the city had turned in their favor
	  again.<a href="#ftn.idp140214263197800" class="footnote" name="idp140214263197800"><sup class="footnote">[27]</sup></a>
	  After being told this they were ushered from the Castle by
	  the guards.
	</p>
<p>
	  After the guards left, they heard
	  Derenedeth's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263199816"></a>
	  voice coming from a nearby sewer entrance.  He directed them
	  to stable their horses at a livery stable where he would
	  meet them.  From there he leds them through the
	  sewers,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263200536"></a>
	  where they were followed by a small shadow that turned out,
	  eventually, to be Kalo<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263201160"></a> Bibkins.  Along the way they
	  were trapped between
	  beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263201768"></a>
	  driving giant rats for dinner and Skaven coming to fight for
	  their brethren.  They turned themselves invisible, hid in a
	  side passage, collapsed part of the tunnel on the skaven and
	  beggars, and in the ensuing confusion they escaped.
	</p>
<p>
	  Eventually they got to the the mage's
	  workroom<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263203000"></a> under the city where the
	  party had fought the imprisoned demon.  There the returning
	  characters found the rest of the characters, who were very
	  confused when asked what was going on, for the returning
	  characters had warned the other characters to leave the
	  house <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the explosion,<a href="#ftn.idp140214263204248" class="footnote" name="idp140214263204248"><sup class="footnote">[28]</sup></a>
	  and they have been hiding in the
	  sewers<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263205176"></a> since
	  then.  The party decided to buy the
	  house<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263205768"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263206712"></a> above the workroom so they
	  would have a bolt-hole in times of trouble.  They stayed at
	  a good inn for the rest of the month they were in Seagate.
	</p>
<p>
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263208088"></a>
	  continued acting strange and moody, often vanishing and
	  reappearing at strange times.  Cormac, Shay, and
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263208744"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263209144"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263209560"></a> interviewed
	  mercenaries<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263210120"></a>
	  for guards for the road, with occasional advice from
	  Gerrod.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263211000"></a> Gim,
	  Winther, and Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263211560"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263211960"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263212360"></a> interviewed laborers and
	  support personnel for the road building.  The dwarves
	  working on
	  Ilene's<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263213000"></a>
	  tower<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263213544"></a>
	  agreed to work for the party on part of the road.
	  Tesla<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263214136"></a>
	  continued overseeing the trading company.
	  Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263214728"></a>
	  retired to the lab and produced stinks and
	  smokes.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263215320"></a> Tesla embarked on a series of
	  magical and surgical repairs which soon moved beyond the
	  realm of repairs.
	</p>
<p>
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263216376"></a>
	  fled Seagate on the morning of 23 Ubard 849 in the company
	  of Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263216984"></a> and an
	  unknown dwarf.  This was the morning the party was scheduled
	  to discuss plans with the count.  The party only knew that
	  Basgoot and Evan had disappeared until after the meeting
	  when
	  Derenedeth<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263217736"></a>
	  reported with the news.  Jamie<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263218312"></a> visited his contacts in
	  the<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263218872"></a>
	  Thieves Guild<a href="#ftn.idp140214263219432" class="footnote" name="idp140214263219432"><sup class="footnote">[29]</sup></a> and
	  returned with the news that the dwarf was
	  Bolg,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263220856"></a> a
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>bad</em></span> character and had abducted one
	  footpad who attacked him on his way out, and killed another.
	</p>
<p><a name="narungreforged"></a>
	  Gim, Cormac, Jamie, Shay Uvall, and
	  Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263222712"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263223096"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263223480"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263223864"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263224248"></a>
	  chased Basgoot, Evan, and
	  Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263224808"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263225192"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263225576"></a>
	  to Mordraug's Lair,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263226088"></a> where Basgoot, Bolg, and
	  Mordraug<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263226648"></a>
	  reforged
	  Narung<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263227160"></a>
	  
	  with the help of an unknown wizard/swordsmith.
	  
	  As part of the process, Narung's
	  demon<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263228520"></a> was
	  released from the sword and the party had to keep it away
	  from the sorcerers while they cast the spell to reimprisoned
	  it.  To do this the characters flew around a lot until
	  Basgoot with everyone's help impaled the Demon in the eye
	  with Narung as sorcerers finished casting the spell.
	</p>
<p>
	  When Basgoot impaled the Demon and the sorcerers finished
	  the spell the Demon screamed so loud it knocked everyone
	  down and then was sucked into Narung.  Basgoot hesitated a
	  moment then chopped Mordraug's head off.
	  Bolg<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263229976"></a>gave off a
	  fiendish, joyous laugh and immediately attacked Basgoot,
	  struggling with him for Narung and nearly killed the
	  Demon-torn warrior.  Shay<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263230648"></a> <span class="emphasis"><em>Entombed</em></span>
	  Bolg, and Jamie,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263231544"></a> thinking quickly, got five
	  fingers cut off (three on one hand, two on the other) but
	  prevented Narung from being <span class="emphasis"><em>Entombed</em></span>
	  with Bolg. Luckily,
	  Winther<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263232616"></a>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Restored</em></span> them, although Jamie would not
	  be able to use them for a month.
	  Basgoot<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263233512"></a>
	  became more nearly normal in
	  appearance,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263234072"></a>
	  though he still had Narung.  The party fled Mordraug's
	  Lair<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263234920"></a> as it collapsed around them.
	  Evan<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263235480"></a> left the
	  party soon thereafter (in disgust?) and wandered south
	  through the mountains.  The party made it back to Seagate
	  and had to leave the very next day, 10 Silemore 849, on the
	  first day of their temporary exile.
