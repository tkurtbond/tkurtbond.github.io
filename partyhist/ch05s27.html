	BAMF, Inc. finally returned to Seagate from their exploration
	of the route through the mountains, with a
	report (see <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Report from BAMF, Inc.">Appendix A, <i>Report from BAMF, Inc.</i></a>)
	of the route, a rough map, and three Auhaami bearing a message
	from the sheik at Tuath's Rest.  BAMF,
	Inc.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263117448"></a> traveled
	through the mountains, picking up a old spellcasting
	hermit<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263118056"></a>
	along the way.  While they were crossing the Vale of
	Morin,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263118920"></a>
	they were stopped twice by ghosts<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263119496"></a> asking about the
	re-establishment of the trade routes.  In
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263120120"></a>
	they had to sneak through the continuing war between the
	orcs and the hobgoblins,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263120744"></a> but found out that
	the humanoids were building crude forts and towers there.
	They finally reached the Giant's Watchtower at the edge of the
	Mountain Wall, where they found a number of
	Auhaami<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263121512"></a>
	camped.  When the Auhaami learned for whom BAMF, Inc. was
	working, three of them<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263122136"></a>
	
	decided to accompany BAMF, Inc. on the return journey.
      </p>
<p>
	On the return trip, they traveled through the plains, where
	they were attacked by Horse Nomads<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263123976"></a> and forced into the Thornwood
	Forest,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263124552"></a> where they were found by an old
	woman living in a small hut, who said they could call her
	Mother Thistle.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263125208"></a> She and the hermit healed the
	injured, bickering viciously all the while.  When the party
	reached the Brastor Holding<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263125864"></a> the old hermit left them.
      </p>
<p><a name="auhaamiAngbar"></a>
	The Auhaami reported that the road from the Mountain
	Wall<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263127400"></a> to
	Angbar<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263127928"></a> was
	better than the
	Korsepolis<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263128504"></a>
	road<a href="#ftn.idp140214263129048" class="footnote" name="idp140214263129048"><sup class="footnote">[26]</sup></a>
      
      (though the trail down the cliff was worse), that the castle
      in Angbar was only partially in ruins, and the Gatar
      Shey<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263131000"></a>
      terminus of the Angbar road was farther from
      Sumaldi,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263131528"></a>
      which was important because
      Batik-al-Yazum<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263132120"></a>
      was increasing the number of his servants, both alive and
      undead, and had been raiding the nearby nomad tribes.  They
      also reported that a nomad from the Southern Desert reached
      them with tales of mass murders in Akhisar, in the fashion of
      the followers of Arakan.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263132952"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	The characters were invited to meet with a group of merchants
	on 9 Sawtes 848 to discuss opening trade with the
	South.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263134008"></a> At the meeting they discussed
	the characters' plans for the trade route and what needs to be
	done. All the merchants seemed very interested, and perhaps
	even willing to help defray the costs of opening the route.
	They invited the party back for another meeting on 25 Sawtes
	848.
      </p>
<p>
	On 15 Sawtes 848 as the characters were walking back from a
	restaurant, a young man burst out of one of the expensive
	homes along the street, yelling for help and saying someone
	has just abducted his father and brother.  The characters
	recognized him as the son of
	Tyrrell,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263135528"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263136200"></a> one
	of the merchants at the meeting, and approached him, but he
	fell to the ground and died, a crossbow bolt in his back.
	Entering the house, they found and killed one of the
	kidnappers and discovered a hidden passage leading to the
	sewers.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263137256"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	Following the trail through the sewers, they discovered
	beggars<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263138248"></a> in
	the sewers, and then a city beneath even the sewers, inhabited
	by a race of rat-like humanoids called skaven by the
	beggars.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263138920"></a> Some
	of these humanoids had captured humans and used them as
	sacrifices in their unholy worship, at which they were joined
	by some depraved humans.  The party rescued the captives and
	escaped into the sewers, collapsing the tunnel to the
	Undercity behind them.
      </p>
<p>
	One of the captives turned out to be Balour
	Shaw!<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263140184"></a>
	Alas, he was incoherent most of the time, and it was clear he
	had been driven insane and could not remember any of his
	previous life.  The party decided they owed him enough that
	they would try to get him healed.
      </p>
<p>
	At the second meeting with the merchants all went
	well,<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263141400"></a> with the merchants agreeing to
	contribute to the building of the road through the Atrusian
	hills, in return for reduced taxes on the goods that pass
	through the party's barony.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263142136"></a>
      </p>
<p>
	On 2 Patluf 849 the count summoned the characters to discuss
	their plans for their barony; the count offered to retire some
	of his soldiers to the area to provide it with a core
	population.<a class="indexterm" name="idp140214263143784"></a> He also contracted with the party
	to take a ton of silver to the south and exchange it for gold,
	which the exchange rate would make very profitable.
