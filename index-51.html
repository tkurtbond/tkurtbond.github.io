<p>I ran across this book as a child, in a local library.  It was
shelved in the children's section, which, considering some of the
content, was probably a mistake.  In any case, it was one of the
formative science fiction novels of my childhood.</p>
<p>Recently I found out that there was a <em>sequel</em> to this, published
many years afterward, and bought a copy.</p>

<p>This adventure started on the 29th. [#july?]_</p>
<!-- [#july?]  I *think* it was July, anyway.  Seems likely, since the
last adventure was July 25th. -->
<p>Some things we wanted to investigate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Witch</p></li>
<li><p>Hermit near Masonburg</p></li>
<li><p>Fairies  (Well, Bartha mostly.)</p></li>
<li><p>Missing Patrol</p></li>
<li><p>Meteor</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="id1"><h4>Actual Play</h4>
<section id="where-things-where"><h5>Where things where</h5>
<p>Bartha asked Gertie about a witches.  She had heard of a practicing
witch in the marshes around Riverton, but reports say that the witch is
<em>evil</em>!</p>
<p>The mayor has been directing defenses.  We asked about a hermit south
of Masonburg and he guessed that was Old Hermit Goldsmith — he was the
finest gold smith in Riverton, moved to Masonburg, then moved south.
It has been a decade or so since the Mayor has seen him.</p>
<p><span class="company">Hammer &amp; Block</span> will man bridge bridge defenses while Brock supervises new
defenses for the bridge.</p>
<p><span class="company">Axe &amp; Bow</span> will ride with Sheriff Artair, they will be south of the bridge
(3 miles, about halfway).</p>
<p>Afternoon: Droston is not surprised by a mountain lion.  He &amp; Polonius
kill it.</p>
<p><strong>[From the fellow who escaped the goblin attack?]</strong>:
They discovered tracks in and around the new mine, followed them into
an ambush.  Rain of missiles, then 2 huge hobgoblins with huge axe &amp;
huge hammer.  He observed that they could see in the dark, and they
targeted torch bearers.</p>
<p>The village is mostly stone buildings with slate roofs.</p>
</section><section id="oh-what-do-we-do"><h5>Oh, What do we do?</h5>
<p>30th: We checked with Sheriff Artair, and got a briefing on the
defenses.  He wanted us to patrol.</p>
<p>On Day 3 there is an attack by 3–5 goblins at the bridge.</p>
<p>It takes Onchu 5 days. <strong>[for what?]</strong></p>
<p>Be back in 2 days.</p>
<p>The Tomb of the Dwarven Hero is not far from the bridge, just a mile
or so.</p>
</section><section id="back-in-trouble-again"><h5>Back in Trouble Again</h5>
<p>After 3 hours, not even to new mine, we heard goblins up ahead, making
no effort to hide.</p>
<p>Looks like they have had a little camp here for couple of days, moldy
bread.  We attacked them, unfortunately without coordinating our
attack effectively.  One of the goblins was dressed in strange black
armor with spikes all over it.  During the melee the strange goblin
spit acid at both Bartha and Onchu, wounding Bartha's face and Onchu's
neck.</p>
<p>Eventually we killed the rest of the goblins and the strange goblin
sped off faster than anyone could follow.</p>
</section><section id="friends-in-high-places"><h5>Friends in High Places</h5>
<p>Whaler Appleby came bringing a message: the Lady of the Valley asked he
speak with Bartha &amp; her friends.</p>
<!-- she lives wh.x.x.x.x -->
<p>We noticed that Whaler's quiver was stocked more than usual.</p>
<p>Whaler told us that Nigel (the brownie) was recovering.  Whaler gave
us (specifically Bartha) a necklace with a gem that glows.  He lead us
south and up the valley wall, in places we've never been before,
though we've lived in the valley all our lives.  Large stream
cascading down, 1 mile west &amp; much higher, underbrush forms a tunnel
stream flows through.  We crawled a long way through the beautiful
stream/tunnel, necklace brightening up in the shade, until it opens up
into a small level glade by grove of beautiful trees (300 yards by 300
yards or so).  The glade is surrounded by steep cliffs.</p>
<p>The Lady of the Valley told us that goblins are pouring forth from an
ancient fissure to the south, thousands of them.  They will kill and
eat everything in their path, and they are heading to Masonburg.</p>
<p>She told us we might have a chance if we can make allies with the
woodland elves.  She said that she knows Bartha has a good heart, but
the others must prove themselves by doing a task for her.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>To Droston</strong>: you must find a Sprig of the Blue Orchid, which can only be
found on the grave of the most heroic heroes of legend, and bring it
to her.  K(Nature): Blue Orchid — cannot grow in sunlight, gets its
energy from heroism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To Onchu</strong>: you must learn to dance with the fairyfolk.  F.F. are known to
have dances in glades.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To Polonius</strong>: you who have been cruel &amp; callous … must make amends
for your crimes &amp; take all that you have and give back to everyone
you have wronged. [Didn't have to give up clothes, weapons,
or tools, but did have to sell his armor and give away all his money.]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The enchanted necklace with the gem turns on if you touch it, and off
if you touch it again.</p>
<p>We waited for dawn, then Polonius and Droston started down to begin their
tasks.</p>
<p>During the day Whaler made up love poems and brought Bartha honey.</p>
</section><section id="droston-s-task"><h5>Droston's Task</h5>
<p>Droston headed to the Tomb of the Dwaven Hero, and down into the
tunnel.  Eventually it came to a flight of stone stairs that lead down
10 feet or so into cold black water.  He removed his armor, put his
candles and fire-starter in a waterproof sack, left his lantern
hanging on the wall, and swam through the passage, to find another
flight of stairs that lead up to a tunnel that lead into a room with
Dwarven runes carved on each flagstone of the floor, and an
inscription on the left hand side of the tunnel, just before the room
that read: “Those who know me know that I was.  Those who need me know
what to use.”</p>
<p>In the center of the room was a sarcophagus.</p>
<p>The room was circular, with mostly square flagstones.  The following
is the layout of the runes on the flagstones, roughly transliterated
from the Drawvish, with the entrance tunnel from the bottom, at the G
&amp; H runes.</p>

<p><strong>[–25 XP to Bartha for M.A.H. apparently blurting out the solution;
T.K.B. was too flustered by the puzzle to even notice.]</strong></p>
<p>Droston was flustered by the puzzle (and T.K.B. was over-thinking
things way too much), and as he stood looking at the room he heard a
whoosh, and the air turned bad.  Evenually he started out along the

<p>Polonius talked to Sheriff Artair about the eggs on chair, manure in
saddle bags, itch powder in bed (which Artair allowed had upset his
wife considerably), … how many nasty tricks did Polonius play on
Sherriff Artair, anyway?</p>
<p>Polonius sold his armor and repaid the dozens, if not hundreds, of

harmonious dance, Onchu felt at one with everything.  Then he
collapsed and slept the rest of the day.  Bartha and Whaler partied the
night away and end up <strong>very</strong> good friends.</p>
<p>Next day Onchu had <em>no</em> hangover, but noticed that his hands are longer &amp;
more slender, and now his skin had a slight greenish brown forest hue
and his scar was almost covered.  Bartha was asleep with Whaler tucked
up close.  Onchu looked in the pool and found that he looked like an elf
(he's now essentially a half elf-elf: +4 to sneaking in woodlands, low
light vision).</p>
<p>Onchu still looks like Onchu, but a more handsome, elvish Onchu.</p>

played that you might want to skip this entry.</p>
</div>
<p>I got to run another Labyrinth Lord session for the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a>.</p>
<section id="attending"><h2>Attending</h2>
<p>Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.</p></li>
<li><p>M.A., playing <em>James the Cleric</em> and <em>Jeffrey the Monk</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>T.A., playing <em>Glen the Strategist</em> (a wizard) and <em>Dooley the sly</em> (a thief).</p></li>
<li><p>E.A., playing <em>Curufin the Elf</em> and <em>Drusilla the Ranger</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>L.B., playing <em>Taffy the Halfling</em> and <em>Alice the Cleric</em>.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="healing-and-hunting"><h2>Healing and Hunting</h2>
<p>After their narrow escape from the valley last time, they decided to
find a safe place away from the valley and rest and heal.  James and
Alice spent their days healing the wounded, while Drusilla spent her
days finding food for everybody.  After five days they were ready to
try again.</p>
<p>This time they made a plan: they'd lure out the orc guards into an
ambush, some staying outside out of immediate sight of the tunnel
entrance, while a couple went in and apparently got scared and ran
out.   Luckily the orc guards fell for the deception and headed outside.
The P.C.s slaughtered the guards, then moved in and systematically
cleaned the orcs' tunnel complex out, ending with the orc chieftain.
They even found the secret door.  Then it was back to town with their
loot.</p>
</section><section id="reflections"><h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>It was nice to see them have a solidly successful session, after
having two sessions in a row of spectacular failure.  They were so
excited that they were finally taking the monsters down.</p>
<p>We had more time to play this time, which helped a lot.  And having
the fourth player (and thus two more characters) made things move
along more smoothly, too.  These old-school modules really do need a
larger party of adventurers.</p>

</ul></section><section id="manual-labor-shopping"><h2>Manual Labor &amp; Shopping</h2>
<p>Last session they'd been captured by goblins who stripped them of all
their equipment and most of their clothing, but did accept a ransom
offer.</p>
<p>Following up T.A.'s suggestion last session that they look for work, I
decided they would stay around the keep for a while and try and find
work, so they could get enough money to buy some new equipment.  They
found some work as guards, some work digging sewers for the keep, and
some random odd jobs around the keep.</p>
<p>T.A. suggested that they'd have probably cached the hides from the
three deer Drusilla killed the week they were camping, so that they
could pick them up on the way back.  I allowed that it was a likely
thing for them to have done.  Then T.A suggested they'd probably have
cached the 6 shortswords from orcs they killed, and I allowed that it
was a reasonable thing for them to have done.  Then T.A. suggested
that they'd cached the money they were carrying, and I said no way, no
how.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a month of work, they pooled their money and figured out
that each person had about 25 gp to buy equipment.  James sold the
shortsword and 2 javelins he got as loot.  Jeffrey sold the javelins,
but kept the shortsword.  Glen sold the shortsword and javelins as
well.  The others kept them, so they didn't have to buy a weapon.
After this the players worked at reequipping themselves.  At first
they didn't think they'd be able to afford any armor better than
padded, but by cutting down their lists and the non-armor-wearing
characters loaning the other characters a little bit of money, they
ended up being able to afford leather armor, and slings and sling
bullets for ranged weapons. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2009/05/04/p003-ll/#slings" id="id1">1</a> Eventually <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2009/05/04/p003-ll/#herding-cats" id="id2">2</a> they
were all outfitted, and ready to go.</p>
</section><section id="oops-take-2"><h2>Oops, Take 2!</h2>
<p>So, they set out east and then north along the road leading into the
borderlands.  When they got to the area of the road nearest the valley
where they'd found the goblins, they again left the road and pushed
their way through the thick undergrowth of the forest until they
reached the semi-clear valley.  This time they decided to explore the
<em>other</em> side of the valley, climbing up the hill above the first
thicket in the valley.  There they found another cave entrance.
Having learned from their mistake last time, they decided to try
stealth.  The three that had <span class="skill">Move Silently</span>, Jeffry the Monk,
Dooley the Sly, and Drusilla the Ranger, would try to sneak in, while
the other three would wait at the cave mouth for a yell.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dooley and Drusilla made a lot of noise as they went
in, so they motioned for the others to follow them in.  The first
thing they saw, in the light of their torches, was a section of wall
covered with niches, which all contained severed heads in various
stages of decomposition.  Fearing for their lives, they immediately
ran out of the cave and Dooley, looking for somewhere to hide, lead
them further into the valley, downhill slightly, to another large
thicket.</p>
<p>As they rushed into the thicket, through the heavy bushes at the
outside into the lighter undergrowth of the inside, they noticed it
concealed, at its lowest point, just above where it edged onto the
flat valley floor, another cave entrance.  Then they noticed the
kobolds in the tree throwing javelins down at them.  Before they got
out of the thicket they had two men down, Dooley and Jeffry.  Once out
of the thicket they ran full speed for the road, only to see that orcs
had come out of the <em>first</em> cave mouth, and were throwing javelins, as
well as the kobolds on the edge of the thicket throwing another round
of javelins.  Luckily, nobody else was downed, and they saw the orcs
and kobolds laughing at them as they vanished into the brush.</p>
<p>They made it to the road, and not hearing any immediate pursuit,
stopped to let James cast <span class="spell">Cure Light Wounds</span> on Jeffry, the
worst hurt, and luckily M.A. rolled pretty well, healing enough of
Jeffry's wounds so that he was conscious and able to get up.  At the
same time Drusilla attempted to bind Dooley's wounds to keep him
from bleeding to death.  Drusilla succeeded, so Dooley stabilized.
And that's were we left them.</p>

<p>I've always thought that D&amp;D nerfed slings, so I ruled
that if they used stones they gathered the slings did the stated

slings would do <span class="dice">d6</span> damage.</p>
