<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>[Session report by B.MC., lightly edited]</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Actual Play</h3>
<div class="section" id="here-be-loot">
<h4>Here Be Loot!</h4>
<p>After escaping with the only serious injury being Azrulektos's burnt
and useless arm, our adventurers sorted through the booty captured.
Mooramuh forced open the chest and we found a magic ring that made the
wearer feel better about sailing (a <strong>[Captain's Ring]</strong> which gives a
+2 bonus to Boating) which was given to Karl Kroc, a yellow potion
(restores power points) and $4,375 ($3,938 after 10% salvage fee).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-sad-sad-day">
<h4>A Sad, Sad, Day!</h4>
<p>On the 8-day voyage back to Baltimus to find healing for Azrulektos’
arm, we happened upon the black pirate ship, a sloop known as the “Red
Fox”, attacking the crumbster ship named “Windfall”.  We defeated the
pirates, saving some of the Windfall’s crew, and captured the pirate
captain.  Unfortunately, Mooramuh accidently threw her beautiful
mallet far, far away into the ocean never to be seen again.  The Fox
had been chasing the Windfall for two days.  We found $1,070 in
general loot on the Fox and also found a pair of thieves slippers (+1
climbing and stealth) which Azrulektos took.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-happy-happy-day">
<h4>A Happy, Happy, Day!</h4>
<p>We were given a $6,750 salvage bounty for the Windfall and $10,000
bounty for the Red Fox when we reached Baltimus.  We sold our skiff
for $5,000 and bought the Red Fox for $20,000.  We found, through
amazing, stupendous luck, that there was a very powerful healer named
Benga Mamoto in the village of Tulago.  He was from an Earth slave
ship.  We also bought Mooramuh a 2-handed great axe ($500) with a
strap ($100) to replace her mallet.  She subsequently bought a formal
gown ($268) and went on a date with the weaponsmith Grimnar, having a
wonderful time talking about our adventures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moorumah-the-shark-killer">
<h4>Moorumah the Shark Killer!</h4>
<p>We hired two privateers and two novice sailors to help sail the ship
and also resupplied for the trip to Tulago.  We also repainted the Red
Fox sea green and the sails blue before leaving port.  Our ship was
attacked a half day from Tulago by a giant shark that was almost as
large as the ship.  Azrulektos pummeled the shark with screaming water
bolts and Mooruamuh jumped to its back attempting a killing blow.
Unfortunately she missed and the shark began to swim to the depths
with her holding on.  Azrulektos fired another volley of bolts and
stunned the fish which sank to the depths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="healing">
<h4>Healing</h4>
<p>We easily found Benga and he agreed to heal Azrulektos’ arm for $1000
and the promise that we would search for his brother Machawi (~410 lbs
and 7’8” tall), who is larger than an elephant (whatever that is), and
was last seen on the slave ship the Black Prince.  The healing took
one week during which time the crew relaxed and Mooramuh worked
lifting heavy things and making $35 spending money.  We ended up
having $2537 after paying crew, repairs, supplies and various trading
and fees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aftermath">
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>Each PC each got <strong>+2 XP</strong>.  B.MC. submitted a session report, so
Azrulektos got a <strong>bonus +1 XP</strong>.  (Azrulektos has 15 XP, Karl Kroc
has 14 XP, Moorumah has 14 XP).</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Session report kindly provided by M.A.H., and lightly edited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Actual Play</h3>
<p>We have $3663 and a Letter of Marque, which allows us to attack
pirates and get a percentage of the value of the ship and cargo.  We
paid the Letter of Marque, and then headed out 4 days out to Knells
rock and 4 days back.  Before heading out, we go to our stash first.
Azerlectos notices that around the chest on the floor of the ocean are
a bunch of dead fish men.  Kahena like to eat Doreen.  We loaded up on
food and headed back to Baltimore.  We received a total of $1800
profit.</p>
<p>Mooramuh was trying to see if there are any pirate ships, and there
were some observed in the Sea of Pirates in the area ast of Balkus and
Calib's rock.  We filled up one cargo space with provisions, which
cost $500.  We decide to go to the third island from the South in the
Whip Islands.  Before we go, we buy one canon for $200, which takes up
one cargo space, plus ammunition and grapeshot.  We end up buying 10
grapeshot, 10 chainshot, and 200 shot for a total of $300.</p>
<div class="section" id="off-to-the-whip-islands-again">
<h4>Off to the Whip Islands Again</h4>
<p>Then, we are attacked by swarms of bird-like creatures.  <strong>[Razor
Wings]</strong> We defeat these swarms, but some crew members are lost.  John
Smith has perished, and Caras also died.  The dead were buried at sea.
After some expert navigation from Karl, we arrive at the island, where
we search for treasure.  We do find treasure, worth $80, plus gold and
silver items worth $1000.  We also find a very ornate short sword
which is obviously not just an ordinary short sword.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="octopus-pie">
<h4>Octopus Pie!</h4>
<p>Then, Azrulektos notices a snake-like creature coming out of the ocean
towards us.  Actually, it's huge, and there's more than 1.  It turns
out to be an octopus.  Yay!  We defeat the octopus and make calimari.
We then descend down into the dark, watery pit from which it came...
Octopii travel backwards, with their tentacles first, and then their
head wth the eye following behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="octopon-caves">
<h4>Octopon Caves</h4>
<p>We encounter a large tunnel that splits into smaller tunnels.  One of
the smaller tunnels opens up into a 20-30 yard wide chamber, with part
of the chamber being above water.  There are a lot of ledges here,
some above and some below water.  Lots of mermen statues are here,
some with swords and some unarmed.  We conjecture that this is some
sort of gathering place for a cult that worships the octopus.  Then,
on one of the ledges, we spy a small golden glint. The glint turns out
to be a small, golden triangle.</p>
<p>In addition to the several ledges, there are a large number of tunnels
leading from the chamber.  We also see a throne at the far end of the
gloomy chamber.</p>
<p>Mooramuh goes to investigate the throne.  She sits on the throne and
commands all creatures to follow her and bow before her.  Then,
something grabs her from the murky water below and pulls her
underwater.  A large battle begins, with mermen creatures coming up
from tunnels seen and unseen.  They party takes refuge on the throne
ledge, and then Trix finds a secret passage behind the throne.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="riches-and-wounds-not-in-that-order">
<h4>Riches and Wounds, Not In That Order</h4>
<p>We retreat into the secret passage, with some brave members of the
party retreating last to cover the others' departures.  Then, we
proceed with great haste to flee the island.  We escape to the boat,
with 8 of the mermen in close pursuit.  Azruleektos loses the use of
one arm from having been seriously injured by fire and acid in the
underground chamber.  We finally make it back to the boat, with only a
few Klingons.</p>
<p>M.A.H. gets a benny next session for shuffling.</p>
<p>Everyone gets 3 experience points, and everyone gets an advancement
since we all passed 10 experience points.</p>

<p>Went back through <span class="area">J</span> to <span class="area">50</span>, where they had discovered
the secret door.  They went through and discovered skeleton.  Jeffry
has the boots.  Spent a bunch of time arguing, which lead to a
wandering monster encounter: 4 goblins easily killed, with no loot.
Went through second secret door, explored <span class="area">63</span>, nothing
valuable.  Headed north &amp; Dooley ran into a gelatinous cube.  Others
pulled him back and fled.  Argued about how to kill the gelatinous
cube, which lead to another wandering monster encounter: 22 goblins,
the rest of the tribe, looking for their lost 4 scouts.  This left
half of the party unconscious, but thanks to the staff of healing,
wand of paralyzation, &amp; <em class="spell">sleep</em> they survived.  They had used
up their healing for the day, so went back to the keep for 1 week,
then on to <span class="area">62</span>, where they opened coffins until they found a
wight.  It rolled a <strong class="dice">3</strong> for its attack on its surprise round,
then lost initiative to the party, whereupon James rolled well and
turned it.  It fled.  They found a hidden compartment with a helmet,
which Dooley promptly put on.  Alas for everybody, it was a <strong class="item">helm of
evil</strong>.  Intra-party conflict ensued, until Dooley was rendered
unconscious by Curufin's sleep.  At the end, the <strong class="item">scroll</strong> went
to Alice, the <strong class="item">+1 flaming sword</strong> to Jeffry, the <strong class="item">elven
boots</strong> to Dooley.  Gelatinous cube loot: 4 cp, 5 sp, 5 ep, 3 gp,
2 pp, <strong class="item">wand of fireballs</strong>.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I was really off at this session, even though I had been looking
forward to it.  The kids were unfocused and I was unable to get them
to concentrate.  Eventually I gave up.  The kids played some of Lily's
new games (Doodle Dice) until Charlita called for her kids to come
home.</p>

<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p><strong>1st day:</strong> They all hunted, since Mad Sammy's stores were running
low.  They found 20 days worth of food, which they shared with Mad
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>2nd day:</strong> They went back to the crypt, to the room with the orange
and green painted keyholes.  The two shadows attacked them, but
luckily for the PCs, by this point in the adventure many had magic
weapons, and they were able to land some good solid hits.  The shadows
faded into the gloom, and then attacked again when the PCs attention
was diverted.  This time the party handily disposed of the shadows.</p>
<p>They then used the Green &amp; Orange Rod Keys, and the secret door
opened.  The climbed down the chain (a couple slipped, but caught
themselves) to the lower level and opened the double doors into what
turned out to be the final room of the crypt.  It contained two stone
coffins with statues atop each.  They were talking about pulling down
the statutes so they could open the coffins when the statue on the
left coffin attacked — it was actually a gargoyle.  They killed it
without much trouble, and turned to the statue on the right.  That
statue was firmly fixed to the coffin and they were unable to pull it
down.  They turned back to the other coffin, which opened easily.
They pulled out the treasure and read the note wrapped around the
ring, and heard the banging and screeching start in the right-side
coffin, while simultaneously the statue from that coffin fell and
struck two of the party glancing blows.</p>
<p>Despite the noises from the coffin, they opened it with the key
none-the-less — the lid was pushed back, and a medusa sat up,
surprising them all.  All but one of the PCs were turned to stone by
the baleful gaze of the medusa.  Grimmin was the lucky adventurer, and
he resisted the gaze once again, while he ran around behind the other
coffin, where he quickly rifled through his backpack and found the
silver mirror.  Standing up with the mirror before him, he avoided the
medusa's gaze, while she looked full into the mirror and was turned to
stone.</p>
<p>Grimmin was left alone, surrounded by the petrified bodies of his
friends.  The <em class="scroll">Stone to Flesh</em> scrolls they had found earlier
were also, unfortunately petrified, as was all the treasure they had
accumulated before this room.  Fortunately, there was plenty of
treasure in this room.  After spending a night with Mad Sam, Grimmin
set off for civilization to find more scrolls of <em class="scroll">Stone to
Flesh</em> and a novice wizard to accompany him back and read the scrolls
to free his comrades.  Eventually he did, but it cost him all the loot
from the last room.  He traveled back to the crypt with Harlan, his
hired magic user, but as they came down the steps they were attacked
by skeletons.  Grimmin, knowing that if Harlan was killed it was all
up for his companions, bravely threw himself in the path of the blow
intended for Harlan, and was stuck by the other skeleton as well, and
luckily survived both.  After that, with help from Harlan's Magic
Missile, it was easy to finish off the skeletons.</p>
<p>Once they got to the statues, the magic user read the scrolls and the
PCs were restored.  After a night's rest in Mad Sammy's basement they
all (except for Sammy) set off for civilization.  However, on the
first night out, on the sleeping Grimmin's watch, they were attacked
by wolves.  Once awake they fought back valiantly.  When the Guardian
of the Crypt, a great glowing orb with one eye, appeared they were at
first taken aback, and feared the Guardian had killed Harlan when it
sent a bolt of magical energy into the tree where Harlan had hidden.
However, Arlow ended up killing it with one <em class="spell">Magic Missile</em>,
and they finished off the wolves without too much difficulty  They
returned to tell Sammy that his nightmare was over, and then all
(including Sammy, this time) left for civilization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="loot-xp">
<h2>Loot &amp; XP</h2>
<p>The loot for the final room was 5930 gp, all used to buy scrolls and
hire Harlan to read them.  The previous loot was 3108 gp, so everybody
got 388.5 gp.  Total monster XP for the whole adventure was <strong>797 XP</strong>
divided by eight PCs and rounded to <strong>100 XP</strong>.  Total XP with the
loot (once they got it back to civilization), per PC, was <strong>1230 XP</strong>
each.  Not even James the Thief leveled!</p>
<p>So ended the <strong>Fabled Curse of the Brigand Crypt</strong>!</p>

<div class="section" id="afterward">
<h2>Afterward</h2>
<p>I pointed out to the kids that very little of their final XPs came
from killing monsters, that most of it came from taking their
stuff, and that if they could do the later without the former they'd
be better off.</p>
<p>We talked about what game to play next, during the school year when
L.B. isn't here, and they eventually decided on <cite>Evernight</cite>, the
<cite>Savage Worlds</cite> campaign, at T.A.'s suggestion.  That was fine with
me!</p>
<p>Next week, when L.A. <em>is</em> in, we'll work on <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em>.
We are getting near the end, and L.A. has said that she doesn't want
it to end.  I'll have to see what I can do about that.  Perhaps I'll
populate one of the dungeon maps I've drawn recently, and make it the
<em>Cave of the Unknown</em>…</p>
