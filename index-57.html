<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p>They reached the village of Iron City, where the bandits were supposed
to have lived, in the late afternoon.  They searched several of the
houses, until they reached the storehouse.  They broke in the door
(the tongue of the lock tore out of the jamb) and questioned poor mad
Sammy, who was frightened by them but called down enough to talk once
they showed him no harm.  He babbled about everything but several
times repeated to them that they should <em>not</em> let “the eye” see them,
and that it roamed at night.  They decided to spend the night with
him, and barred the door, as best they could.</p>
<p>The next day they searched the rest of the town, found the well, and
entered the temple.  They pulled out the stones and the key, and
luckily pulled the key out last, so no one got bit.  James pulled out
the <em>red</em> stone, but gave it to Grimmin.  Elsie pulled out the <em>green</em>
stone.  Arlow pulled out the <em>gray</em> stone.  James pulled out the
<em>gold</em> stone.  Hermes pulled out the <em>blue</em> stone.  John pulled out
the <em>key</em>.  After that they opened the Crypt with the key and explored
room <strong>1</strong>, and over the course of several days opened all the burial
vaults in that room, killed the undead, and found the treasure and the
keys.  They had to rest and heal at least twice and each time took at
least two days.</p>
<p>After clearing out the burial vaults in room <strong>1</strong>, they went down the
stairs to room <strong>2</strong>, where T.A. insisted on searching for secret
doors, repeatedly, using up almost five hours of daylight.  Eventually
they opened the door with the key from burial vault <strong>E</strong>.  Entering,
they heard the sound from the east end of the corridor, investigated,
and found the pit, <strong>4</strong>.  Seeing the green-daubed hole, they decided
to investigate and James slid down a rope held by Elsie and Hermes.
The 2 skeletons immediately attacked, and Grimmin slid down to help,
but fell.  John slid down too.  Grimmin blunted his battle ax on the
stone wall and dropped it, while John dropped his flail after also
hitting the wall.  After that John turned both of the skeletons, who
spent several rounds trying to uselessly climb up the east wall of the
pit, while James, John, and Grimmin tried fruitlessly to hit the
skeletons, seeming to fling their weapons repeatedly into the corners
of the pit.  Eventually they managed to kill the skeletons.  James
decided, looking at the green-daubed keyhole, that it was larger than
any of the keys they had found so far, and probably hooked up to some
mechanism, rather than a lock for a door, and that whatever it might
be, it was beyond his current skill.</p>
<p>They crawled back up out of the pit, and one of D.B.'s characters (I
think it was John) tried to step around the corner to the north
corridor, which tilted and dumped him back into the pit, for more
damage.  Next they explored the western end of corridor <strong>3</strong>, where
James set off the arrow trap, which luckily missed.  They went in to
the crawlspace in <strong>5</strong> with Grimmin in the lead and he killed the
skeleton with ease!  They came out of the crawlspace into <strong>6</strong>, a
long narrow room with 12 coffins.  T.A.'s characters went to look at
the 4 open coffins and were attacked by two ghouls and a skeleton from
room <strong>7</strong>.  D.B.'s characters, more cautious, had stayed by the
crawlspace, but moved up to help their comrades.  Luckily, the ghouls
attacked Arlow and Elsie, who as elves were able to ignore the
paralyzing effects of the ghouls.  The resulting fight destroyed the
ghouls and the skeleton.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For some reason I think the first fight in the sarcophagus
happened right after the fight with the ghouls, but my notes say
it happened in the second session.  I'll put it both places for
now.</p>
</div>
<p>They decided to open one of the closed stone coffins, and while
pushing the heavy lid off, Elsie, along with several others, fell into
the coffin on top of the skeleton.  The others managed to (eventually)
exit the coffin, but poor Elsie was too entangled with the skeleton.
Eventually the party killed the skeleton, but Elsie ended in the
negative hit points <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2010/08/06/brigand-crypt-part-1/#negative" id="id1">1</a>, so they went back to
Mad Sammy's with Elsie on a floating disk to recover.</p>

<p>Coming out of <strong>38</strong> down the slope the party was surprised by an
ambush at the tee, where the bugbears from <strong>35</strong> and <strong>39</strong> were
waiting.  They retreated up the slope, drawing the bugbears after
them.  They wiped out the bugbears at some cost to themselves, and
returned to the keep, where they sold the urn for 175 gp.  10 gp 11 gp
8 gp  7 gp 10 gp 6 gp 9 gp 7sp 12 gp 7 sp.</p>
<p>Returning after a few days they missed seeing the tripwire for a new
deadfall, tripped it, and several were injured by the fall of heavy
stones from the ceiling, while another line ran to a clanging alarm,
bringing the chief bugbear and mate from <strong>36</strong> and 6 guards (who had
been out hunting last time).  The PCs retreated back out the tunnel,
got in position on either side of the entrance and ambushed the
bugbears as they came out.  They killed the chief and some of the
guards, and the others retreated to <strong>36</strong>, where they barricaded the
door shut.  Currifin and Drusilla broke the bracings and the door
swung open, but poor Drusilla fell and knocked herself out.  She was
struck immediately by three of the remaining bugbears, but was quickly
pulled back by James.  Alice was nearly killed (down to negative HP)
but was pulled back and healed (requiring 2 Cure Lights from James),
and then she cured Drusilla.  Eventually they killed the remaining
bugbears and discovered their treasure.  They found the secret
passage, and killed the 3 fire beetles and took their light clands.</p>
<p>They then returned to the bugbear lair and discovered the stores in
<strong>37</strong> and decided to return to the keep for healing and a wagon.
They returned with the wagon (200 gp deposit, 20 gp rent) and killed
the humanoids in <strong>40</strong> and <strong>41</strong>, while freeing the eval human, who
accompanied them, all unsuspecting, back to the keep.</p>

lair.  They follow the east corridor to <strong>38</strong>, where they use <em>sleep</em>
to put down some of the bugbears.</p>

<p>Went to <strong>F</strong>, where Dooley didn't notice the new pin-type poison
trap.  He made his save and was unconscious for 15 minutes.  After
that he disarmed the trap and moved the bar and pushed the door open
with a ten foot pole, knocking over the stack of noisy items.  5
hobgoblins came from <strong>26</strong>, while 1 warned <strong>27</strong>.  Killed all 5 and
were standing over the bodies when 6th hobgoblin showed up, saw the
massacre and ran back to <strong>27</strong>.  PCs ran after them.  (BTW, already
used up both of their healing spells.)  Dooley checked door of <strong>27</strong>
for traps and then they opened the door and rushed in.  They were
surprised by 6 hobgoblins hiding behind various rocks.  Curufin was
taken to 0 HP in the first round.  Eventually killed all the
hobgoblins.  Searched and Jeffry found the secret door!  3 hobgoblins
with scale and mace, three with shied, scale, and longsword.  7 sp 4
ep 4 sp 4 ep 4 ep 4 sp 7 ep 5 sp 2 ep 5 sp 5 ep 4 sp 5 ep.</p>
<p>They decided to rest overnight in <strong>27</strong>.  Set up 5 watches.  <strong>31</strong>
attacks on watch 3 (Jeffry, Dooley, Guards 1 &amp; 2).  <strong>23</strong> attacks on
watch 4 (Dru, Jeffry, Taffy, Guard 1).  Hobgoblins from <strong>28</strong>—<strong>31</strong>
came in 1st rush, except females from <strong>30</strong>.  All died eventually.
After that females from <strong>30</strong> came and were killed.  Glen down to 0
HP.  Dru found secret door at other end of 20 foot corridor.   Dru and
Taffy stayed to watch their unconscious comrades.  They searched the
rooms beyond and found the false bottom of the iron chest, but Dru
and Taffy heard a noise beyond the barred door and Taffy ran for the
others.  The hobgoblins burst through just as Dooley ran back, jumped
the barrier, and poured a healing potion down Curufin's throat.
Curufin woke up confused, the hobgoblin's threw javelins, Dru was
injured, Dooley was taken to negative HP.  Then next round initiative
was simultaneous, Dru injured more, Curufin used their fireball
scroll, killed all the hobgoblins.  Dooley and Glen are unconscious.</p>
<p>Next Morning: Glen 1 HP, Dooley 2 HP.  Curufin, Taffy, and Alice go
back to town.  100 GP deposit for team and cart, 20 gp rent.  Jeffry
pays 1 gp each for the guards' funerals.</p>

<p>They went to room <strong>24</strong>, where they ran into 2 hobgoblins.  1 whip, 1
javelin, 2 longswords, 2 chain.  #1: 5 cp, 2 sp, 3 ep.  #2: 2 cp, 6
sp, 6 ep.  Silver armlet, 135 gp.  The 2 captured guards took service
for arms &amp; armor &amp; room &amp; board.</p>
<p>Taffy let the gnoll loose, and it attacked her.  Dooley and Jeffry
join the grapple and kill the gnoll after it drives Taffy to –2 HP.
Dooley let out the orc with Glen holding a crossbow on him.  The orc ran
for the head of the valley, and Dooley yelled “Come back!”, even as
he, Taffy, Curafin and Drusilla loosed arrows.  Dooley and Taffy's
shafts killed the orc.  Jeffry lost his Lawful alignment and his
monkhood for suggesting, with glee, torture and murder.  100 gp reward
from the captured Merchant.  +1 magic dagger (to Glen).  Jeffry gave
his share of the treasure to Drusilla.  “Jeffry the Shamed!”</p>

<h2>Afterward</h2>
<p>M.A. was <em>not</em> happy that Jeffry was not a monk any more, and I had
him have Jeffry do some penance between games to regain his happy
monkhood.</p>
