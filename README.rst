This repository is my blog at https://tkurtbond.github.io/ and the
``src`` branch is the actual source of the blog and the ``master``
branch is the generated files.  I use Nikola_, a static site
generator, to generate the blog and its command ``nikola
github_deploy`` to deploy it to the ``master`` branch.
