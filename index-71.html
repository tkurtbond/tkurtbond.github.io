<p>We're playing the adventure <cite>Shaggradd's Hives of Peril</cite> from
<a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#fighting-fantasy-the-introductory-role-playing-game">Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game</a>
(FF:TIRpG), so if you haven't played that you might want to skip
this entry.</p>
</div>
<p>As I've mentioned <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/">before</a>, I've been planning to use the RPGs derived
from the <cite>Fighting Fantasy</cite> gamebooks for pickup games with the <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/the-kids/">kids</a>,
today we continued with the second adventure from <cite>Fighting Fantasy —
The Introductory Role-playing Game</cite> (FF:TIRpG), <cite>Shaggradd's Hives of
Peril</cite>.</p>

<li><p>Oswald — SKILL 10, STAMINA 21, LUCK 12, who was already lost in
the treasure vaults in the dark.  (This was C.A.'s character from
the earlier game, but he wasn't available today.)</p></li>

<li><p>E.A. played Letty Letitia — SKILL 10, STAMINA 19, LUCK 10.</p></li>
<li><p>M.A. played Toth — SKILL 8, STAMINA 17, LUCK 9.</p></li>
<li><p>L.B. played Amber — SKILL 12 STAMINA 21 LUCK 8.</p></li>

<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p>Amber introduced herself as <strong>Judy</strong> for some reason.  (The player did
this deliberately.  I have no idea why.)</p>
<p>Started in <span class="area">1</span>, went to <span class="area">19</span>, then <span class="area">22</span>.  They
skinned the weretiger.  On to <span class="area">23</span>, <span class="area">13</span>, <span class="area">14</span>.
Finally Lettie looked in <span class="area">18</span> and then the door shut.</p>

<p>The kids were giddy, and the game didn't last very long, alas.  No
doubt the chaos contributed to my inability to take good notes this
session.</p>

<p>The items you can find on this blog under the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/">category Actual-Play</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="categories/actual-play/">tag actual-play</a> (except for this entry) describe actual play
sessions from some of my games.  They tend more to describing in-game
events, but sometimes talk about mechanical aspects of the game
illuminated during the session, or creative aspects of running a game.
Sometimes they're just a session recap, written so that when I come
back to that campaign in a week or a month or six months so I can look
up the details of the last couple of sessions to figure out what was
happening and where the campaign is going.  These latter sometimes
are barely more than a list of the places the PCs visited and events
of notoriety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCs went to <span class="area">20</span>, where Olsman chopped the
head off an ogre with one blow.  Afterwards they started down the
stairs to <span class="area">23</span>, but the stairs collapsed into a slide, and much
hilarity ensued as they tried to avoid stabbing and bashing each other
as they tumbled down and landed in a deep pool.</p>

hardback with 671 numbered pages followed by 14 pages of
advertisements.  (In a smaller book, I might have complained about
that many pages of advertisements, but in a book this large it doesn't
seem excessive.)  From my earlier quick perusal of the PDF and a brief
scan of the hardback today I'm very pleased with the content, and I'm
looking forward to using this in my game.  To the folks who worked on
this: well done!</p>

<p>I've got a problem — I like RPGs just as area of study and as
artifacts, even if I never get to play a particular RPG.  When I was
younger I'd buy new systems just to compare them, even if I never
expected to play them.  Even now I sometimes buy multiple editions of
a game to compare them, often delving back to through the earlier
editions of game to see how things have changed and what's been lost
along the way, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/25/ive-got-a-problem/#osr-analysis" id="id1">1</a> although usually only if I'm actually
planning on playing one or more editions of the game.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, I've got more RPGs than I'll ever get a
chance to play, and I'm still interested in buying new ones.</p>
<p>I have resolved to play more of the games that I already have, though,
and I've got specific plans for several of them.</p>

old-school games very interesting.  I'd love to see even more games
given this treatement: the various versions of <cite>RuneQuest</cite> and
<cite>BRP</cite>, the Palladium RPGs, the various varieties of <cite>Rolemaster</cite>
and its children, and so forth.  A pity that my obsessions have yet
to drag my unorganized ruminations over the mountains of clarity
and illumination and into the blogosphere.</p>

<p>We're playing the adventure <cite>Shaggradd's Hives of Peril</cite> from
<a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#fighting-fantasy-the-introductory-role-playing-game">Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game</a>
(FF:TIRpG), so if you haven't played that you might want to skip
this entry.</p>
</div>
<p>As I've mentioned <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/">before</a>, I've been planning to use the RPGs derived
from the <cite>Fighting Fantasy</cite> gamebooks for pickup games with the <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/the-kids/">kids</a>,
and today I was able to put that plan into action, starting as planned
with <cite>Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game</cite>
(FF:TIRpG), using the second adventure from the the book, <cite>Shaggradd's
Hives of Peril</cite>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/24/ff-tirpg-shaggradds-hives-of-peril-play-session-1/#well" id="id2">1</a></p>
<div class="section" id="attending">
<h2>Attending</h2>
<p>M.A. and E.A. were watching a movie, but T.A. (as always) was eager to
play, and as we were getting started C.A., who had heard us talking
about gaming earlier and said he wanted to play, wandered in and
wanted to join in, so I had him roll up a character too.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.K.B. — GamesMaster.</p></li>
<li><p>T.A. played Ezarik (e-ZAR-ik) — SKILL 8, STAMINA 17, LUCK 10.</p></li>
<li><p>C.A. played Oswald — SKILL 10, STAMINA 21, LUCK 12, who was already
lost in the treasure vaults in the dark.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actual-play">
<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p>T.A. had rolled up his character and was speaking with
<span class="npc">Shaggradd</span> when C.A. showed up.  I decided that Ezarik would
meet C.A.'s character, Oswald, down in the treasure vaults, where he'd
been sitting in the dark after his candle burned out after he‘d run
from a monster.  So we rolled up a character, who turned out to be
skilled, strong, and lucky, named him Oswald, and went back to Ezarik.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Shaggradd</span> blindfolded Ezarik, lead him around by hand, spun him
around in a circle, told him to hunker down, and pushed him into a low
tunnel.  After he refused the 2% extra on the 10% entrance fee for her
to cast a <em>Reverse Teleport</em> on him, she pulled off the blindfold and
pushed him further in, and slammed a door on him.  After he lit his
lantern, he could see that he was in small tunnel with rotting wood
sides, that opened out into a taller and slightly larger roughly
circular room.  The floor of the tunnel and the room were both dirt,
and in the cent of the room was a pit trailing down into blackness,
with a rope tied to a black spike hammered into the rotting wall of
the chamber, covered with spider webs.</p>
<p>Descending the rope he ended up in a <span class="area">1</span>, small chamber dug into
the earth, with four exits at right angles.  He took the exit to the
west, leading to <span class="area">30</span>, a large cavern with a skull carved into
the east all, with three tunnels leading out through missing teeth in
the skull.  He headed out the middle passage, and after a little while
heard the sound of a stream, but couldn't see it. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/24/ff-tirpg-shaggradds-hives-of-peril-play-session-1/#no-bridge" id="id3">2</a> A
little further on he found a little man, about a metre tall and
dressed in what appeared to be the entire skin of a small dragon<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/24/ff-tirpg-shaggradds-hives-of-peril-play-session-1/#dragonhide" id="id4">3</a>, wings and tail included, cleverly formed so that the
rear feet were boots, the fore feet were gauntlets, and the head was a
helmet, with the face appearing through the mouth of the beast,
sitting next to a puddle of wax that was all that left of his candle.
This was Oswald, a hobbit, and as it turned out he was very hungry.
He had lost his way while being chased by a monster, and then his
candled had burned out, leaving him waiting in the dark, as he hand
not taken advantage of <span class="npc">Shaggradd</span>'s offer of a <em class="spell">Reverse
Teleport</em> either.</p>
<p>Continued on to <span class="area">35</span>.  Pulled lever.  Could see just a <em>bit</em> by
the light of a phosphorescent plant growing on the surface of the
cavern.  Not knowing where they were they headed out the only entrance
they say, and back to <span class="area">30</span>, where they recognized the skill.
This time they took the right (north) passage to <span class="area">31</span>, and
started to enter the middle passage there, but a <span class="creature">troll</span>
popped out of the passage and attacked them.  After exchanging a few
blows with the troll and getting a small cut on one cheek, Oswald
fled, leaving behind his companion and his companion's lantern!
Ezarik stayed behind and fought the troll for another round, and then
pursued his companion, and luckily the troll did not follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oswald ran back down the passage to <span class="area">30</span>, bounced off
the wall and ran through the passage to <span class="area">1</span> and straight across
and out the passage that lead to the collapsing stairs, slide down the
stairs, stumbled across the gravel beach, through the water, and
finally sat down on the ground beyond the stream in <span class="area">19</span>, in the
dark again.  He could smell some delicious fruit nearby….</p>
<p>Ezarik, fleeing the troll, guessed at the likely route Oswald had
taken and quickly found him, sliding down the collapsing stairs into
<span class="area">19</span> and wrenching his arm in his fall.  Glad to be reunited,
Oswald drinks some water from the stream while Ezarik eats some of his
provisions.  The smell of delicious fruit was coming from some large
green fruits on a strange underground tree.  After they rested a few
minutes they continue exploring, taking the passage east until it
forked and then taking the north-east slanting passage until it ended
in a dead end, <span class="area">20</span>.  Returning to the fork in the passage, they
entered a very hot room half filled with burning coals, <span class="area">21</span>,
where a fiery lizard squeaked at them.  Oswald squeaked back, but the
lizard was puzzled.  They left that room through another door, where
they discovered a tall red-headed man sleeping (<span class="area">22</span>).
Unfortunately, he woke up and was very angry, demanding that they
leave immediately.  They went back through the door to <span class="area">21</span>,
Oswald apologizing to the man for waking him up, and the man calming
down and going back to bed.  Then they returned to the cavern with the
stream, where Oswald climbed up into the tree and started to pick a
fruit, noticing a key in the tree as he did so.  Unfortunately, just
at that moment, five of the fruit hatched into large angry goose-like
red birds, and began attacking.  Oswald fled east into the passageway,
as did Ezarik, though he tried and failed to grab the key as he fled.</p>
<p>And this is where we ended for the evening.</p>
<p>Over the course of the evening we learned that Oswald's dragon armor
and dragon tooth sword were not family heirlooms, that he could play
both the piano and the flute, and that he had lost a wand and a map
earlier in the these caverns.</p>

<div class="section" id="reflections">
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>The simplicity of <cite>FF:TIRpG</cite> makes it a great pickup game. There are
only three stats, SKILL, STAMINA, an LUCK, so rolling up a character
is trivial, which is great for when somebody unexpected shows up in
the middle of things and wants to play — say, for example, a
three-year-old, C.A.  And the rules are so simple that after you have
played a few times you can easily remember them, so you don't even
need to have your rule book handy.</p>
<p>Playing with a three year old has a few pitfalls.   C.A. has a great
vocabulary, and uses pretty complicated sentences, but his
pronunciation is somewhat unclear, adding to our communication
difficulties.   He's not familiar with the fantasy genre, so doesn't
know that there are no flashlights or cars or technology.  And he
hasn't quit figured out that once his character is in a situation, he
has to deal with the situation using only the resources he has at hand
already and what's available in the situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he's also a lot of fun to play with.  He comes up
with lots of interesting details about his character, he tries
interesting things, he has fun seeing what's going to happen next.</p>
<p>T.A. liked the game, though it was not his favorite.  (I think he's
used to more detailed systems, and prefers them to something this
simple.)</p>

<p>The first adventure from <cite>FF:TIRpG</cite>, <cite>The Wishing Well</cite>, is
shorter.   It is also redone in Arion Games' <cite>Advanced Fighting

<p>It's not immediately obvious from the map, but later
area description text makes it clear that the corridor from
<span class="area">30</span> to <span class="area">35</span> crosses the stream on a bridge.  Since I
hadn't read that area description yet, I went with an unseen but
not unheard stream.</p>

<p>C.A. was dressed in a dragon suit, making him look
much like an Anne Geddes picture, so I carried that element into
the game.</p>

<h2>I missed out…</h2>
<p>Somehow I completely missed out on the <cite>Fighting Fantasy</cite>:series (<cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite>)
gamebooks during their initial run.  Probably, since I was already
playing <cite class="abbrevtitle">AD&amp;D</cite>, <cite class="abbrevtitle">T&amp;T</cite>, and <cite class="abbrevtitle">DQ</cite>, the solitary fun of the gamebooks was
not as appealing as the social fun of tabletop RPGs, and what little
desire I had for something like gamebooks was was more than adequately
served by <cite class="abbrevtitle">T&amp;T</cite> solo adventures.  In any case, I never owned any <cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite>
gamebooks until I picked up the 2003 iBooks reprints of <cite>The Warlock
of Firetop Mountain</cite> and <cite>The Citadel of Chaos</cite>.</p>
<p>This also means that I missed out on the <cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite> and <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> RPGs, as
well.  Thank <a class="reference external" href="http://fightingfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Hamaskis">Hamaskis</a> for Internet bookstores!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-internet-rpg-forums-are-amazing">
<h2>…but Internet RPG Forums are amazing</h2>
<p>I had run across a mention of a <cite>Fighting Fantasy</cite> RPG, somewhere
(probably on <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/">rpg.net</a>), and eventually figured out it was <cite>Fighting
Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game</cite> (<a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a>) and
purchased a copy from a used bookstore online.  It was easy to find,
as I recall. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#many" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>Mechanically it is the system from the <cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite> gamebooks, but with
explanations for new tabletop gamers of how to use it for tabletop
gaming.  It is actually a nice introductory RPG, but it was a little
too simple for the game I wanted, and my interested stopped there for
a while.</p>
<p>(I only got <cite>The Riddling Reaver</cite>, a collection of adventures for
<a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a>, in 2011, after I got <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a>.)</p>
<p>At some point I figured out (again, probably by reading on <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/">rpg.net</a>)
that the <cite>Advanced Fighting Fantasy</cite> RPG was a different set of books
from the <cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite> RPG, with a more detailed system, and it was probably
what I should have been looking for instead of <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a>, but my
interest had fall asleep; no doubt in part because the third book of the
set, <cite>Allansia</cite>, was reputedly difficult and expensive to get. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#few" id="id2">2</a></p>
<p>However, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arion-games.com/">Arion Games</a> edition (<a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a>) published in 2011
reawakened my interest.  I got that edition, and liked the system and
setting, but wondered how different it was to the original <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a>.
Eventually I decided I wanted to compare <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> to the original
<a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a>, so it was back to the Internet bookstores.  <cite>Dungeoneer</cite> and
<cite>Blacksand!</cite> were relatively easy to find (<cite>Dungeoneer</cite> in
particular), but an relatively affordable copy of <cite>Allansia</cite> was more
difficult.  Eventually I was successful. Yesterday <cite>Allansia</cite> arrived,
and today <cite>Blacksand!</cite> arrived.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="at-my-table">
<h2>At My Table</h2>
<p>I'm planning to use <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> as my pickup game with the <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/the-kids/">kids</a>, the game
we play when something else has to be canceled, too few players are
available, or I'm just too tired to play anything more complicated.
I'm looking to make use of the <cite>Titan</cite> setting, with all its
over-the-top fantasy elements.</p>
<p>I'm going to start with the original <cite class="abbrevtitle">FF</cite> RPG, play that for a few
sessions, add in the stuff from <cite>Dungeoneer</cite>, then <cite>Blacksand!</cite>, then
<cite>Allansia</cite>, maybe all in the same episodic campaign.  Eventually I'll
transition to another campaign, using the <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> 2e rules.  At the end
of it all I should be able to do a good comparison of all three rules
sets.  Maybe then I'll do an actual review, but don't hold your
breath.</p>

<p>These paperbacks are approximately 21.5×28 cm, pretty much exactly
8.5×11 in.  These editions of <cite>Out of the Pit</cite> and <cite>Titan</cite> are
essentially straight reprints.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the license <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arion-games.com/">Arion Games</a> has to publish <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a>
precludes PDF versions of the books.</p>

<p>I don't know if <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a> was easy to find because they
printed so many of it, or if it was just part of the large print
runs they used to use in general.</p>

<p>I suspect that <cite>Allansia</cite> was published late enough that
print runs in general had shrunk in size considerably, even if the
print run for <cite>Allansia</cite> in particular was small simply because it
was the third book in the <a class="reference internal" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> RPG series, which was bound to make
it less  popular than the gamebooks in any case.</p>

      <p>Lacking Natural Simplicity is one, not particularly flattering,
