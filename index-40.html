    <p>One of the things I need to do before I'm ready to build a house is
simplify.  I've got a lot of accumulated junk — physical and
mental, real and virtual — that I need to sort through, decide what is
important, and get rid of the rest.</p>
<p>As far as the virtual goes, I need to simplify the tools I use: the
software I use to maintain my web site and blog, the tools I use to
process e-mail, and so forth.</p>
<p>As far as real goes, I need to get rid of actual physical objects:
things I don't use, things I don't need to need to use.</p>
<p>The mental is much harder, but probably more necessary.</p>

    <p>I suppose in part it is because I simply reached the maximum level of
frustration with my previous set of tools that I could stand, and have
had to start looking at alternatives.  (Unfortunately, this happened
with a number of things all at once, so I'm looking for replacements
for several of the tools I use constantly.)</p>
<p>In part it is simply because I need more practice writing.  At one
point in my life I did a lot of writing, and fairly easily.  Of late,
it's been harder and has happened much less.  I need to get back into
practice.</p>

    <p>I'm slowly figuring out more about <a class="reference external" href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">pyBlosxom</a>, and will eventually end
up with a reasonable set of blog tools.  This evening I've been
figuring out more about statically rendering my blog, which ought to
overcome the noticable lags when accessing my blog.  I haven't
switched the actual blog over to static rendering yet, but I'm getting
closer.  So far the incremental part doesn't seem to be working.</p>
<p>I considered moving to <a class="reference external" href="http://jared.henley.id.au/software/awb/">awb</a>, an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>-based Website Builder, but I
still find the <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> markup slightly nicer.  If only there
was a good reStructuredText to <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/docbook/">DocBook</a> path I'd have no qualms at
all.</p>

    <p>Recently I've decided that I want to build a house.  I've been reading
various books about different construction techniques, and this
weekend I wandered over the family farm, once with my Dad and once
with my friend H.H. looking at various possible building sites.  The
most picturesque sites, unfortunately, are rather remote, and would
involve long, long driveways and long runs of new electric lines.
There are several locations closer to electricity and the road that
would be nice building spots, but some are closer to neighbors than
I'd prefer, and another is someplace already in use by the farm, so
there's not anything that immediately jumps to mind as perfect.  I
plan to spend a lot of time over the next year observing condiations
at each of the better sites.</p>
<p>I'd like to use a many materials as I can from the family farm in the
construction of the building.  I'm considering building a cob house,
which has a number of very attractive features, but which depends
heavily on the local soil for construction material.  Cob houses need
a clay-sand mix.  Almost all of the local soils have plenty of clay,
according to the soil survey, but rather than sand the rest of the
soil is mostly silt, which seems like it would be a problem for Cob.
I can probably obtain sand relatively economically to add to the mix,
but will the existing silt make the mix too weak?  That's what I have
to find out.</p>

        </p>
</div>
    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>I've been having a personal e-mail crisis for the past couple of
months.  (If you've noticed that my e-mail has been even slower and
more erratic than usual, that's why.)  I've been trying to figure out
a better mail setup and due to my complicated use patterns it has been
tricky.</p>
<p>I have dialup Internet access at home, at speeds that are moderately
slow even for dialup.  I have a personal server elsewhere that does
have good internet access, and that's were my e-mail is delivered.  My
main work computer is a Windows XP laptop.  I often work at client
sites, and sometimes work at places that have no Internet access, or
very limited access with strict controls.  I need to read, or at least
refer to my e-mail at all those places.</p>
<p>For years I've used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and ViewMail (aka <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/">VM</a>) to read my personal
e-mail, syncing my e-mail directories between my Internet server, my
home machine, and my work laptop with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a>, and primarily reading
e-mail on my Internet server.  This has worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>I live in Emacs anyway (the Control key is the most worn key on my
keyboard for some reason…) and am thoroughly happy with it for editing
(and probably dependent on it), and VM has been very comfortable as
well.  However, development of VM went into hibernation after the
release of version 7.19, and so hadn't kept pace with later e-mail
developments.  Recently the original author of VM, <a class="reference external" href="http://wonderworks.com/">Kyle Jones</a>,
handed over development to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/">Robert Widhopf-Fenk</a> and development has
picked up again, but it's still lacking some features that I need, and
unfortunately I don't have time to devote to adding them myself.</p>
<p>I can't imagine giving up Emacs for reading e-mail, since it
integrates so well with the rest of what I do and I enjoy using Emacs
and Emacs Lisp, so I'm looking for a new Emacs-based mail reader.  So
far I haven't been happy with any of my choices.</p>
<p>Back when I read USENET news regularly I used <a class="reference external" href="http://gnus.org/">Gnus</a> and loved it.  It
is distributed with Emacs and seems to have regular development and
maintenance.  In theory, Gnus can also be used to read e-mail, but
because of its news reader design it takes a very unconventional
approach to reading e-mail.  I'm not entirely comfortable with it, and
I haven't figured out the best way to integrate my huge archive of old
mail.  Moreover, the documentation is quirky and difficult and the
programming interfaces are quirky and complicated.</p>
<p>There are other Emacs mail readers.  I used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rmail.html">RMAIL</a> for a while before
I moved to VM, but I can't see moving back. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gohome.org/wl/">Wanderlust</a> seems
moribund.  I've used the RAND MH Message Handling System (<a class="reference external" href="http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/">MH</a>) in the
past, outside of Emacs, and there are a couple of modern versions of
that (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nongnu.org/nmh/">nmh</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailutils/">Mailutils</a>).  It turns out there are actually a couple of
extensive Emacs interfaces to it: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mew.org/">Mew</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mh-e.sourceforge.net/">MH-E</a>.  I've looked a
little at both, and have had some luck with each.  I'll have to see
how they compare over time.</p>
<p>I'd be interested in learning about any other Emacs-based e-mail
clients.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CategoryMail">EmacsWiki</a> doesn't seem to have any other likely
prospects, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've finally come up with a way to switch back and forth
between Gnus, Mew, and MH-E while keeping up with my current e-mail,
so I can search for better ways to deal with my old e-mail and
compare new email. I should be back to dealing with e-mail
quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>A <strong>really</strong> impressive and unlikely success would be to find a new
way of reading mail that lets me access my work e-mail, which is in
our corporate Notes e-mail system, from Emacs.</p>

<section id="part-i-origins"><h2>Part I: Origins</h2>
<p>The first <cite>D&amp;D</cite> game I owned was the Holmes blue-box edition of <cite>Basic
D&amp;D</cite>; the first <cite>D&amp;D</cite> game I played was <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> 1E.  I was in junior
high when I got the Holmes box set for Christmas from my parents.  (If
I am remembering correctly.)  That summer I started playing <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>
with a group of my brother's friends from high school, and I played
with them until that group gradually dispersed, some when they left
the state for college, and some when they left the state after college
for jobs elsewhere.  I had long been DMing by then.</p>
<p>I remember seeing <cite>OD&amp;D</cite>'s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldritch_Wizardry">Eldritch Wizardry</a> in the local
hobby store when I first started playing, but I never saw the original
<cite>OD&amp;D</cite> boxed set.</p>
<p>I don't think I ever looked at the later Moldvay/Cook or Mentzer
<cite>Basic D&amp;D</cite> lines, other than buying <cite>Isle of Dread</cite>, thinking like
many that if I was already playing <cite>Advanced D&amp;D</cite> that <cite>Basic D&amp;D</cite>
wouldn't have much to offer. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#basic-dnd" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>My younger brother joined the group at some point.  He got <cite>Tunnels &amp;
Trolls</cite> as a Christmas present one year, from my uncle Chuckie, if I
remember correctly.  We played it several times, but it was a simpler
game than <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> and at the time seemed to offer less, though in an
entertaining way. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#tnt" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p><cite>Gamma World</cite>, 1st edition, was probably the first RPG I bought, other
than <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>.  (How did we buy the <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> books?) We never played
<cite>Gamma World</cite>, for some reason.  Probably because I wasn't able to
figure out the rules, or because it was too gonzo.</p>
<p>While still in junior high, or perhaps my first year in high school, I
ran across <cite>DragonQuest</cite>.  Although it was written in a “numbered
rules” style that I was unfamiliar with (having never played wargames)
that required me to read it closely several times through before I
understood any of it, I was fascinated by it from the very first read.
<cite>DQ</cite>'s skills gave all characters interesting distinguishing
abilities, where as in <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> only thieves had similar such abilities
(other classes depending on selection of spells to distinguish the
magic using classes and magic items to distinguish the others.)  The
D100 based unified mechanic used by <cite>DQ</cite> was also very attractive, as
was the more detailed combat system.  The professional skills seemed
less restrictive and therefore less of a mere game construct than the
equivalent <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> classes.  The fact that every character could learn
magic also seemed freeing.</p>
<p>The fact that the only <cite>DQ</cite> adventure that I was able to find at the
time was Paul Jaquays' <cite>The Enchanted Wood</cite> was also a plus, because I
found it to be head and shoulders above any other adventure I had seen
at the time.</p>
<p>I can seen now that  most of these things I liked about <cite>DQ</cite> were the
things that added to greater detail in distinguishing characters, as
well as what I called realism them, but today might more accurately
call verisimilitude.  I think a good part of it was that by this time
<cite>AD&amp;D</cite> had become its own genre and I wanted something less tied to
those particular tropes.  <cite>DQ</cite> seemed to simulate a wider variety of
fantasy than <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>.</p>
<p>I think it is safe to say that I was suffering from an anti-D&amp;D
backlash at this point.</p>
<p>At some point I bought a copy of Avalon Hill's <cite>Powers &amp; Perils</cite>.  (If
my memory of buying this from the hobby store in downtown Clarksburg
is correct, I must have bought this fairly early on in my gaming
career.)  At some other point I bought Iron Crown's <cite>Rolemaster</cite>.
Both of these blew my mind with complexity.  <cite>P&amp;P</cite>'s setting, however,
was another glimpse at a non-<cite>AD&amp;D</cite> fantasy universe.</p>
<p>A friend of mine bought <cite>Traveller</cite> early in our gaming careers.  We
tried making characters a couple of times, but were never able to
figure out what we should do with them afterwards — I think we could
never bridge the gap between dungeon crawling and monsters killing
characters in <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> and 40– and 50– year old ex military characters
in Traveller.  I don't think we had any <cite>Traveller</cite> adventures to
help us along.</p>
<p>I ran a very successful <cite>DragonQuest</cite> campaign in my first year at
college with three of the original group and a couple of other
players, using Paul Jaquays' wonderful <cite>Enchanted Wood</cite> adventure
setting.</p>
<p>Later in college I started a long-running campaign set in SPI's
minimal <cite>Frontiers of Alusia</cite> setting using <cite>DragonQuest</cite> at the
beginning.</p>
<p>My leaning to greater detail and verisimilitude lead me in time to
<cite>GURPS</cite>, with a small detour along the way for 3rd edition
<cite>RuneQuest</cite>.</p>
<!-- Where did I buy RQ? -->
<p>I bought <cite>RuneQuest</cite>, 3rd edition (<cite>RQ3</cite>, the Deluxe Boxed Set) and
<cite>Griffin Island</cite> (also a boxed set) in stores, somewhere.  (I think
this must have been near the time they were released.)  Like
<cite>DragonQuest</cite>, I found them fascinating.  Unlike <cite>DQ</cite> I never got my
group to successfully play <cite>RQ</cite>.  The players found <cite>RQ3</cite> character
generation to be too complicated, alas.  <cite>RQ3</cite> and <cite>Griffin Island</cite>
were a glimpse into a style of culture-based gaming that I had never
encountered in my <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> experience, but were complicated enough that
my players hated character generation, and we never got much beyond
that.  I never saw <em>any</em> of the Glorantha materials until much, much
later, post Internet.  <cite>Griffin Island</cite>, though, even with the
occasional incoherence in its Glorantha-less state, resonated with
more depth than anything I had yet seen.  (I never realized, until
years later, that the Paul Jaquays whose <cite>DQ</cite> adventure <cite>The Enchanted
Wood</cite> had so opened my eyes was also one of the authors of <cite>Griffin
Island</cite>!  I guess at the time I didn't pay much attention to the
authors/designers of games.)</p>
<p><cite>GURPS</cite> for me was about even more finely grained definition of
characters.  Learning from problems my players had with <cite>RuneQuest</cite>
character generation, I created <cite>GURPS</cite> versions of all their
<cite>DragonQuest</cite> characters.  Since, in the process of simulating all
their <cite>DQ</cite> abilities with <cite>GURPS</cite>, I'd along the way upgraded their
characters somewhat in power, everybody had fun and it all worked out.
Already accustomed to a hex-based tactical combat system and
role-under skills from <cite>DQ</cite>, it was an easy adjustment to <cite>GURPS</cite>, and
the campaign continued successfully for many more sessions.</p>
<p>I think, however, that later I moved away from <cite>GURPS</cite> because
making/updating characters was such a pain, even with the assistance
of Bill Seuer's <cite>GURPS</cite> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html">MAKECHAR</a> program.  (Let us just say
that the main villain of the campaign, and evil wizard, ended up a
1000 point character, and all the PCs were 300 point characters.)</p>
<p>Chaosium: <cite>Call of Cthulhu</cite>, <cite>Elric!</cite>, <cite>Stormbringer</cite>, <cite>Prince
Valiant</cite>, <cite>Pendragon</cite>, Universal Supplements.</p>
<p>I ran a short <cite>Elric</cite> campaign after my <cite>Frontiers of Alusia</cite>
campaign.  This worked better for my players than <cite>RQ3</cite>, as it used
simpler implementation of Chaosium's house system, <cite>BRP</cite>.  Despite
the brevity of this campaign I have fond memories of <cite>Elric</cite>.</p>
</section><section id="part-ii-hiatus"><h2>Part II: Hiatus</h2>
<p>After that there was a hiatus in my gaming.  I continued to buy and
read RPG material, but didn't have a regular group.</p>
<aside class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The rest of this is rambling and desperately needs rewritten.</p>
</aside><p>WFRP — First encounted in WD?  Then bought main rulebook.  At
first dismissive of the rules, but again fascinated by the picture
of the old world and the high quality of some of the adventures.
The one time I tried running WFRP things didn't work out with
my gaming group.</p>
<p>Most of my buying WFRP was during my hiatus?</p>
<p>I really only came to understand <cite>RuneQuest</cite> during my hiatus from
gaming, in the 90s, when I started seriously to track down the <cite>RQ3</cite>
material I'd never know about, including the post RQ3 fanzines.  I
even found a copy of <cite>RQ2</cite> in a game store in Austin, Texas, while there
on travel for work.</p>
<p><cite>RQ</cite> found … earlier than <cite>GURPS</cite>, later? but only understood much later
in 90s during my serious <cite>RQ</cite> buying days after I ran a long <cite>GURPS</cite> campaign
(<cite>Call of Cthulhu</cite>/<cite>Elric</cite> helped understand/like RQ?) and bought <cite>RQ2</cite>.

<p>We completely missing out on the flexibility of the T&amp;T
saving roll system — not surprising, since we never saw any of the
T&amp;T solos that used it so extensively — and how that gave T&amp;T gamist
tactical play without complicated rules, unlike D&amp;D 3e and 3.5e.  I
think we'd have played T&amp;T more if we'd understood that, but I
only really understood after reading some of comments Ron Edwards
made about T&amp;T in 2003, first in the rpg.net thread <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=46923">Sell me Tunnels &amp; Trolls!</a>

    <p>I've found that, for an abstract game that can take place just in your
head, there can be a lot of <strong>tactile</strong> fun to RPGs.  Rolling dice
and moving miniatures are the obvious ones, but there are others.
Gaming tokens (glass “stones” ) are used by many games and gamers,
either as a component of the system or informally by the gamers for
marking various things.  Some games, like <em>Savage Worlds</em>, use cards.
Miniatures terrain, whether three-dimensional, printed tiles, or
simply drawn or a battlemat, adds a lot, and not just to the visual
aspects of the game.  Cards that represent character states, like buff
and condition cards for D&amp;D, or the effects of spells, or cards that
have monster or spell stats, are also neat and passing them around
adds to the fun of the game.  Drawing maps for the games, drawing a
scene out on a battle map, and making handouts can all be tactile fun,
and then handing out the maps and other handouts to players so they
have the fun at looking at them and passing them around and pulling
them out when they suddenly realize what they're really showing them.</p>
<p>All of these things can add a great deal of fun to RPGs.</p>
