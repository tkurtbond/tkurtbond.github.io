</ul></section><section id="introduction"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we were joined by I.MC. in his first ever roleplaying game
session!</p>
</section><section id="actual-play"><h3>Actual Play</h3>
<p>We got a call on the communicator — <span class="pc">Mauler</span>, a friend of <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> from the old
days, has been an undercover spy, and has heard they took the
superhero <span class="npc">Champion</span>. and converted him to <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> has been looking for
him, but hasn't found him, but has heard that he might be activated
from the satellite and that his old pals have a mission to the
satellite.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Anvil</span> is <span class="power">Mind Controlled</span>.</p>
<p>It takes four hours to get to the satellite.  We have 6 fusion missiles
and 3 sonic torpedoes for our Manta.  <span class="npc">Anvil</span>'s authority codes are a
couple of weeks old but should still work.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Quillik</span> will pose as <span class="npc">Anvil</span>'s bodyguard and will carry us through the
scanner in one of our traveling vials in his mount.</p>
<p>We head out to sea underwater for five miles, then surface and head
up towards space.  In the atmosphere, a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> man of war questions us.
<span class="npc">Anvil</span> knows that the satellite we're heading towards is Satellite 15 and
bluffs.  They decide they'll escort us through the fighting.  After
two hours we're through most of the fighting and the man of war sends
us the rest of the way with an escort.  In part thanks to the escort's
presence we're cleared to enter the satellite docks despite be
unscheduled.   Once they figure out it is <span class="npc">Anvil</span> on board they're very
respectful.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Quillik</span> sets off a partial alarm when he passes through the regular
scanner.  After a quick explanation from <span class="npc">Anvil</span> that <span class="npc">Quillik</span> had been
injured in a recent fight with Earthlings <strong>[???]</strong> the guards go get a
hand scanner and it goes off around <span class="npc">Quillik</span>'s mouth.  The guards ask
him to open his mouth, which he does, but the vial carrying us pops
out and falls to the floor in front of the guards.</p>
<p>We get out and one Super Fin uses <span class="power">Force Control
(Maneuverable)</span> on us.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> wounds him. <span class="npc">Anvil</span> flees to a corner and
waves his arms about futilely and wibbles, as commanded by <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> using
<span class="power">Mind Control</span>.  <span class="npc">Quillik</span> and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> attack back, but do not succeed.
Some of us recognize the Super Fin as DeNeg, <strong>[¿¿¿Spelling???]</strong> once
a superhero in the old days.  DeNeg uses <span class="power">Force Control (Bind)</span>
on <span class="pc">Raum</span>, who breaks it by becoming intangible.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> attacks DeNeg,
hitting for 22 damage.  War Spheres are heard approaching and <span class="pc">Mauler</span>
throws DeNeg into War Spheres, destroying one.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> does suppressive
fire against the War Spheres, shaking several.</p>
<p><strong>[¿¿¿Who was the other Super Fin??? I remember it was a villain. How
did we kill him???]</strong></p>
<p><span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> hears noises from the control center.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> rushes in and smashes a War
Sphere so hard he spins and falls down afterward.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> moves in and
sees <span class="npc">Pyros</span>, who looks half-<span class="group">V'Sori</span> and part zombie.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> kills
<span class="npc">Pyros</span>. <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> sends the “broadcast drone self destruct” command from
a terminal in the control center.  A warning message is issued:
“broadcast drone self destruct — Champion ultimatum enabled.”</p>
<p>We find 4 technicians, and escape pod blasts off; it has life signs.
We convince the remaining 4 technicians to enter another escape pod
and we sabotage the reactor core then leave in our Manta.</p>
<p>In the last ½ hour of our journey back to Earth we see Champion — the
strongest super hero of the leading super team before the invasion —
chasing our Manta.  He had been blasted by the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> during the
invasion and thought dead by most, but it turns out he had been
converted to a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> and set up as a deadman trap.  He hits our ship,
wrecking it, and then comes back to peel it open to attack us.  <span class="pc">Raum</span>
hits him.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> hits him with a gun and then his power, and kills him!
We get shrunk and let <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> fly us down to Earth.  The battle left us
right over Star City.  Our ship lands in Northpoint, on <span class="org">SoCorp</span>
(the elite <span class="group">V'Sori</span> police and <span class="power">Mind Control</span> force) headquarters
and destroys it.</p>
<p><span class="group">V'Sori</span> ships are retreating as <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> flies us down to near our old
hideout, since we don't want to attract attention to the new hideout.
Someone tries to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> <span class="pc">Force Caster</span>, and when we land <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>
appears with <span class="org">Neptune Guard</span> and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Repent!  Come over to me, or die!”</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="aftermath"><h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>Each PC each got <strong>+5 XP</strong>.</p>
<p>M.A.H. was planning that we'd have the big battle with <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> next time
(which should finish the campaign) and then we'd have one-shots until
January, when M.A.H. will run a <cite>D&amp;D 4e</cite> campaign.</p>
<p>However, the players were talking and decided they wanted at least one
more episode so everybody could level before the big fight with <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>,
perhaps as a flashback, and M.A.H. said she'd see what she could do.</p>

<p>A <span class="rule">Critical Hit</span> happens on a natural twenty on an attack roll,
and damage is doubled.</p>
<p>There <strong>isn't</strong> a <span class="rule">Critical Misses</span> rule, but sometimes on a
natural one on an attack roll something embarrassing and
funny but usually non-damaging happens.</p>

<p>Went back to 3rd level.  K, S, Za, Ro, Av, Ga popped (teleported away
by a trap).  Semi &amp; Av force open door into corridor.  Pop, Pop.  Find
corpse behind: Semiriah and Karl find 270 gp, 2 gems worth 150 gp
each.  Non-poppers encounter a monster — a giant centipede.  Kill it
in one round with 22 points of damage — it had 2 HP.  Lots more
popping.  3 corpses at I: 300 gp, 140 sp, &amp; dagger.  Room with pews
and altar and ash - clerics uneasy — dark powers here.  Altar has:
dagger, potion, ring, scroll, short sword, 25 gems, necklace.  Avery
casts Detect Evil: nothing on the altar glows, pews don't, but altar
and ash glow eveil.  Pick up potion with rope on pole, sweep other
stuff into bag on pole with another pole.  Door slams shut, Avarey and
Skeggi and Karl and Gustavio make saves vs. Spellsl and everybody else
fails.  Those who failed see the entire chamber turn to flames and
takes one point of damage, then a second point of damage.  Four of us
broke down the door and we all fled.  Back to town.</p>
<p>Gustavio uses Detect Magic on the items: dagger from corpse is +1 (to
Gustavio), dagger from alter is +1 (to Semiriah), potion (polymorph),
ring (silver, magic, unknown, to Karl), scroll (unknown), short
sword +1, +2 vs. spell casters (to Maurey).</p>
<p>Gems: 8×100 gp, 2×150 gp, 5×250 gp, 7×300 gp.  Necklace: 800 gp.</p>

<p>We block off unused tunnels in our headquarters.</p>
<p>Raum hears voices from far away down unexplored tunnels — a commander
giving instructions to troops — it sounds like <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Need to get <span class="group">V'Sori</span> separatist at lab in docks area, he'll lie on the
floor as soon as trouble starts, he's expecting you.  Here's a
map.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> makes a <span class="skill">Knowledge (Engineering)</span> roll and knows that <em>we</em>
can't be heard by <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>We search for info about Dr. <span class="npc">Aiden</span> online.  He is a member of the
Association of <span class="group">V'Sori</span> Scientists.  They have a lab near the docks, but
the location is classified.</p>
<p>We try to follow voices down the tunnels, but can't find them.</p>
<p>Chow's restaurant is closed down — the whole city is a war zone.</p>
<p>Docks had Farmers' Market, a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> naval outpost, and is area run by
the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> (a band of criminals).</p>
<p>We call Mr. Fixit, who gives us the address of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> weapons
facility that includes <span class="npc">Aiden</span>'s lab; it's well protected and very
secure.</p>
<p>We take one of our panel vans (from our time near the University motor
pool).  Our Fin is riding in the passenger seat and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> is driving.</p>
<p>We are stopped by a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> patrol and <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> tries <span class="power">Mind Control</span>,
but fails.  Raum tries <span class="skill">Persuasion</span> (thank goodness for
<span class="power">Gifted</span>) and gets two raises: “we've got a vital shipment of
lab equipment”, and gets the ok to continue.</p>
<p>We come to a bombed out road, and are forced to take an alternate
route.  Bunches of <span class="group">V'Sori</span> and <span class="org">Neptune Guard</span>'s jump out from opposite sides of
the road to attack each other as we drive by, and we are caught in the
crossfire. (Most of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> are drones.)  We are interrogated by some
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> and then attacked, they blow holes in the sides of our van.  Our
Fin jumps out of the van to protect us, attacking the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  We
retaliate, and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> takes us through an intersection, leaving dead
bodies in our wake.  When we stop we are interrogated by some of the
<span class="org">Neptune Guard</span>, who recognize us and start to attack, but we kill them, and the
last of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> flee.  Our Fin catches up and gets back in the van.</p>
<p>We are finally outside the <span class="place">Center for |VS| Weapons Research</span> —
it is an unmarked building surrounded by a security fence with guard
towers, a couple of blocks from the actual docks.</p>
<p>We got miniaturized and into vials that <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> carried, then <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> threw
fusion grenades at the guards on the towers, and teleported into the
building.  The first room was a loading area, and probably had a few
war spheres.  There is a second room, with more war spheres.  The
third room is absolutely <em>filled</em> with war spheres; <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> dropped
fusion grenades and teleported to the next room, where we finally
found four <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists and one human (apparently a janitor).  All
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists were lying on the floor.  We ask who “<span class="npc">Aiden</span>” is,
the other scientists point him out, and <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> tries to <span class="power">Mind
Control</span> him <strong>[???]</strong> and fails. <span class="npc">Aiden</span> <span class="power">Mind Control</span>'s <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span>; we
eventually figure out that something is definitely wrong because <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span>
talking and acting odd, but we're still in vials and can't do
anything.  Eventually <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> overcomes the <span class="power">Mind Control</span>
(because <span class="npc">Aiden</span> keeps asking for the location of our base), hits him
with the shrink ray, captures him in a vial, and shakes him
unconscious.</p>
<p>Somebody (<strong>[Who???]</strong>) killed the janitor during this.  I presume we
killed the other <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists once we knew who was who.</p>
<p>As all this was going on we heard a heavy weight bash into the roof of
the building, and the ceilings of some of the other rooms collapse.
When we get to a position to see, it turns out that an <span class="group">Atlantean</span> sub had
been lifted into the air with <span class="power">Telekinesis</span> and was hovering
over the building.  Heroes were leaving the sub, climbing down into
the weapons facility on ropes.  We must have dropped some fusion
grenades near some of the heroes. We saw <span class="npc">Mechnoman</span> climb up on the roof to
see who was dropping the fusion grenades.  At the same time <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> was
struggling with <span class="npc">Aiden</span> so that we could destroy the <span class="group">Atlantean</span> sub with more
fusion grenades.  Eventually we do, and leave the area in our van.</p>
<p>We headed back across the war-torn city.  After about 2 miles, we run
into what appears to be a <span class="org">Longshoremen</span>-manned check point where they are
stopping every vehicle, inspecting the occupiers and vehicle, and then
waving them on into a warehouse.  There must be some other exit,
because we've seen too many vehicles go into the building.  On
approaching our vehicle the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> take our picture to “check against
their database”, then tells us to exit the vehicle.  <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> teleports
out, drop the Fin and <span class="pc">Raum</span>, and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> jumps out.  <span class="pc">Raum</span> jumps into the
middle of a group of <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> and attacks.  Eventually we kill all but two
of the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> and then the leader — Willy the Fin <strong>[???]</strong> puts up his hands
and says that they can help us.</p>
<p>It turns out that <span class="npc">Ricky Six-Fingers</span> and his gang moved out of Southpoint after
<span class="npc">Dr. D</span>'s revelation into a headquarters in Tempest, and the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> know
where it is and are planning to hit it in a couple of days.  The <span class="org">Longshoremen</span>
tell us that they've heard that <span class="npc">Vince</span> volunteered to do the hit on us
and has disappeared <strong>[???]</strong> while he's working on it.  The <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> offer us a
police car to replace our transportation, but <span class="pc">Raum</span> has noticed
police cars getting attacked and asks for other transportation
options.  They have a couple of motorcycles, and we take them.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Willy the Fin</span> gives us a communicator and tells us we can contact them on
channel 6.  He tells us not to use the regular comm system because
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have gotten real sophisticated in exploiting the regular
system.</p>
<p>We head out and get back to our area without any further mishaps.</p>
<p><span class="pc">Raum</span> asks our minion, Frank, to work on the comms issue, starting by
checking the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> comm for surprises.  He finds out that it has an
inactive tracking device which can be turned on remotely, but he is
able to remove it, and we can keep it in a Faraday cage. He also says
he can work out a secure method of communication for us.</p>
<p>We work to figure out how to interrogate <span class="npc">Aiden</span> without letting him
keep attempting to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> us.  Our Fin says that the
<span class="npc">Vince</span> don't like cold: 30℉ makes them very uncomfortable, and we
determine that will be enough to keep him from concentrating hard
enough to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> us.  <span class="place">Joe's Pizza</span> is nearby
and closed for the war, so we go there and interrogate <span class="npc">Aiden</span>.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Aiden</span> wants to defect to those who oppose the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  It turns out that
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> are split — some want to leave earth, thinking that they are
doing more harm than good.  He designed the satellite system to
control the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> drones.  He could stand down all the drones
worldwide.  It can't be done remotely, it has to be done on the space
station.  <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> keeps a space vessel in a warehouse in the Tempest
district.   <span class="npc">Aiden</span> contacted <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> by telepathically broadcasting message
to him — they have met before, so distance is no object.  Each drone
has an auto-destruct function that can be triggered from the
satellite.  Updated battle plans can also be downloaded into the
drones.  The satellite is very heavily defended.  It is manned by
technicians responsible for software maintenance and by Fins, ware
drones, and Super Fins.  The <span class="group">V'Sori</span> <span class="npc">Overmind</span> commanded the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> to attack
Earth at this time.  Several think it was unwise, but when the <span class="npc">Overmind</span>
says something it must be done.  <span class="npc">Aiden</span> opposes because <span class="npc">Overmind</span> has gone mad
and resents the <span class="group">Atlantean</span> overthrow of the <span class="npc">Vince</span> here on Earth.  The <span class="npc">Overmind</span> has
an unreasonable fear of Earth, and has put off the attack several
times, has spent centuries scouting and manipulating behind the scenes
— the <span class="npc">Overmind</span> assisted the Nazis, for instance.   <span class="npc">Aiden</span> hopes that if the
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> fail this time the <span class="npc">Overmind</span> will give up.</p>
<p>The <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have new technology, advanced bio-mechanical manipulation
that allows them to (non-reversibly) change a earthling's biology to
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> biology without affecting any super powers.  (Much improved from
the things along this line that we've seen before.)  Many of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>
we've seen were former prisoners, mind-wiped.  They mind-wipe the
prisoners, load up a standard <span class="group">V'Sori</span> mind profile, perform the
conversion process, and the former prisoner wakes up a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> in mind
and body!</p>
<p>They make drones from former prisoners who are too badly damaged to
make into <span class="group">V'Sori</span> — war spheres are made from those who are the most
badly damaged. Hyper drones are cybernetic — they look more like the
dead.  Hyper drones are also controlled by programs from the
satellites.  <span class="npc">Anvil</span> tells us issuing the “shutdown” or “auto-destruct”
command to all drones is a simple process.</p>
<p><strong>[¿¿¿I have something here about “protect Tempest district”???]</strong></p>
<p>Those who change to <span class="group">V'Sori</span> gain the <span class="racial">Aquatic</span> and
<span class="racial">Telepathy</span> racial abilities, same as <span class="group">Atlantean</span> as far as stats go,
but look like <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  One ingests the agent and the transformation
takes place over a week.  Don't know if it works on <span class="group">Atlantean</span>.  Some <span class="group">Atlantean</span>
have passed for <span class="group">V'Sori</span> (at least to look at).</p>
<p>The team that was to get <span class="npc">Aiden</span> was planning to get the stuff to make
the change so they could sneak in.  His team was <span class="npc">Lucky</span> and
<span class="npc">4-Star</span> and <span class="npc">Mechnoman</span>.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Ricky Six-Fingers</span> is thought to be a legend, one of those criminal bosses that most
people don't think really exist.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Aiden</span> has sophisticated neural package they us on new <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  (<span class="pc">Force Caster</span> says
that's why they invaded: that and revenge on the <span class="group">Atlantean</span>.) <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have
native psionic abilities that make it difficult to mind-wipe one once
it has been transformed.</p>
<p><span class="group">Atlantean</span> <em>do</em> reproduce biologically.</p>
<p>The drone control satellite <em>is</em> armored heavily — nothing but it own
core exploding can damage the satellite.</p>
<p>Five software technicians to correct faulty programs.  Fins can get
things through DNA scanner (We could go in under skin — scanner only
checks the very outside of the  epidermis).  Drones have a safety
feature — they can't attack <span class="group">V'Sori</span>, alas.</p>

<p>Put <span class="hire">Symna</span> and <span class="hire">Gloin</span> in chain from the last episode.
Each hireling has two torches.</p>
<p>Went west down the last unexplored tunnel on <span class="area">Level 2</span>, which we
hand overlooked on our map, it being drawn in so lightly, to a room
with a complex, fancy silver lock on the other exit door.  Trying to
bash it off did no good, nor was Maury able to pick the lock.  We
obviously need a key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh no, we're stuck in a video game, gathering keys!” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2012/09/15/idol-of-the-orcs-s07/#keys" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We gather wood and leather waste from <span class="area">The Lonely Room</span> (the
room with the “walk through walls” A.K.A. teleport trap), threw it in
<span class="area">The Bat Room</span>, lit it on fire, and brought in torches to drive
the bats towards the chimney to the surface.  Semiriah kills one giant
bat with a natural twenty.  Gustavio kills another giant bat.  Orm
kills a giant bat. Avarey kills the last giant bat.  We search the
room, twice, but find nothing.  We travel back to town.</p>
<p>We don't want to tangle with the wight who's room is near the stairs
down, but we have no choice.  What should we do?  Throw money and
blather at it: buy silver weapons and come up with a good tactical
plan to overrun the wight (and the Labyrinth Lord).</p>
<p>We travel to a town where we buy 4 silver tipped spears (30 gp, 8'
long), 1 silver dager (30 gp), 3 silver maces (50 gp).  Unfortunately
for <span class="pc">Gustavio</span>'s desire to spice up his wardrobe and
<span class="pc">Karl</span> 's desire to adorn his beard with jewels, the caravan that
was to bring the town its yearly load of fancy cloth and expensive
jewels was attacked, so <span class="pc">Karl</span> and <span class="pc">Gustavio</span> will have to
return in a year.  (The rest of the party was rather relieved.)</p>
<p>We return to the dungeon and form up before approaching the wight's
room.  We put the silver spears in front: <span class="pc">Karl</span> and <span class="pc">Sallee
Maree</span> first because they're short, and <span class="pc">Maury</span> and <span class="pc">Semiriah</span>
behind them, with <span class="pc">Orm</span>, <span class="pc">Skeggi</span>, and <span class="pc">Avarey</span> ready to
move up to support them with silver maces, if they need help, and
<span class="pc">Gustavio</span> behind them.  The plan is to hold the wight off with
the some of the 8' long spears, while stabbing him with the others, so
he can't touch anybody and steel their life force.  <span class="gm">T.A.</span> comes
up with some rulings on the fly for the situation, and we move
forward.</p>
<p><span class="pc">Gustavio</span> lets off with his :spell`Magic Missile` in the first
round of combat, while one of the characters manages to entice the
wight into impaling himself on his spear.  The rest attack with their
spears, and in the third round <span class="pc">Maury</span> kills it after
<span class="pc">Semiriah</span> hits it.  The wight disintegrates.  There is nothing
useful or interesting in the room, alas.</p>
<p>On the 3rd level, <span class="pc">Karl</span> and <span class="pc">Semiriah</span> and <span class="hire">Zenith</span> and
<span class="pc">Sallee Marie</span> step into a crossroad and vanish after an instant.
They all hear a slight popping sound and the four who vanished find
themselves in a corridor 60' long.  <span class="pc">Semiriah</span> yells, despite a
lot of meta-comments that it will bring monsters, to no avail.
<span class="pc">Maury</span>, with the other group, also yells, also to no avail.
<span class="hire">Zenith</span> starts to panic, but the PCs in the small group manage
to talk him to a state somewhat closer to calm, despite their lack of

    <p>I've got to remember to enter the rest of our <cite>Keep on the
Borderlands</cite> sessions sometime, if I can find my notes.</p>
<p>This entry is to remind me to explain the heroic fight of the doomed
Green Dot Army, who helped make the world safe from Chaos!</p>
<p>I used green glass tokens to represent the party's hirelings, and the
final climactic battle in the Caves of Chaos included a private army
of hirelings, 50 or so strong.  They were a heroic sight setting out
from the Keep for the Caves.</p>
<p>All but four of them died in the battle, and only two of those four
made it back to the Keep.  The party paid for nice funerals, so people
(probably) don't spit at them as they walk through the Keep.</p>

    <p>I got the original <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> (<cite>Advanced Fighting Fantasy</cite>) books
(<cite>Dungeoneer</cite>, <cite>Blacksand</cite>, and <cite>Allansia</cite>) after I got <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.arion-games.com/">Arion
Games</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arion-games.com/aff.html">Advanced Fighting Fantasy, Second Edition</a>), intending
to compare them by reading them and playing them both, along with the
original <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a> (<cite>Fighting Fantasy: The Introductory Role-playing
Game</cite>).  This has gone a lot slower than I intended, but I have played
several sessions of <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#ff-tirpg">FF:TIRpG</a>, and have been rereading and comparing
<a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> and <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> recently, in preparation for playing <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> has been adjusted to make play more consistent,
balanced, and suitable for long-term play.  Starting attributes are
point-buy instead of random, and the values for SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK have
lower ranges — 4–7, 8–16, and 4–7 vs. the original 7–12, 14–24, and
7–12.  There's been some addition of detail — random Armor rolls — and
some other tweaking — weapon damages are higher.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> gains a lot from being presented in one book, and integrating
the <cite>Sorcery!</cite> magic system, but there are some places where it is not
explained quite as well as it could be, and there are some
typographical oddities, the illustrations (most — perhaps all — from
the original <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a>?) are somewhat faded grey rather than the original
black, and I'm not keen on the layout or fonts.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> definitely harkens back to the wilder, early days of RPGs, when
balance was not so important, and the oracular powers of random
dices were used more.</p>
<p>Organizationally <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> suffers from being presented in three books as it
makes reference harder, but pedagogically it may gain — there's a
smaller amount to be learned at once, and it's playable with just the
first book.  The books' smaller physical dimensions make them easier
to hold and read, and the layout is simple and suitable for this size
book.  I think the books generally explain things more clearly, and I
like the movie/TV series metaphor it uses, and the tone of the writing
is a bit more engaging.  And it includes two the mass combat systems.</p>
<p>In short, <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a> is probably the smoother system, though it needs a bit
more polish, but <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> is more charming.</p>
<p>One thing about the system as a whole will be an advantage to some and
a disadvantage to others is that the system is <em>very</em> simple.  <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a>
adds a few simple tactical options, but even so the combat system has
little detail, while in the original <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> there's little besides a
normal attack or a dodge.  Those who enjoy system complexity and
system tactical detail in their systems may find <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff">AFF</a> and <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/22/fighting-fantasy-rpgs/#aff2e">AFF2e</a>
lacking, but those who prefer simple systems will find the combats
easy and be glad to get back to the role-playing.</p>

<p>Deo in a cargo net was dropped twice down to just above the flames due
to problems with the winch. Finally they got him back to the level
they wanted. Haven Zul pulled the little droid into the tunnel.
Unfortunately, he only figured out he needed some way to keep Deo from
swinging back into the shaft like a pendulum once he'd already pulled
him in.  Luckily, he was able to find a nearby cable he could use to
tie him off.  J'Lee tried to lower the cargo net, but failed horribly,
so the brake on the cable broke and the kilometers long cable started
to unwind.  It turns out the cable wasn't properly fastened to the
drum of the winch, so it was going to come loose and drag Deo into the
depths of the flaming, exploding mine shaft.  [No, R2 units don't have
repulsar lift units!]  Haven, acting quickly, got the cable cut off
the cargo net with his fusion cutter from his toolkit.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the Imperials showed up again.  they
engaged in a running firefight as J'Lee and Milagro climbed down to
Deo and Haven.  They fled down the tunnel and the blast door opened
for them, where they found a huge cavern, their unconscious rebel
contact, and non-working blast door controls, so they couldn't close
the blast doors again.</p>
<p>They found the Y-wings, and the Imperials showed up again.  They held
them off with another firefight while Deo programmed the jump
coordinates into one of the Y-wings and then boarded the other, then
they flew out of the cavern, shooting at and being shot at by the
AT-ATs that had chased their contact into the cavern.</p>
