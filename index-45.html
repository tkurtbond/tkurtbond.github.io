<p>This time out I decided that they'd forced by their dismal economic

and ran them through the <em>Pirates of the Spanish Main</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/onesheets.html">one-sheet</a>

<p>They did pretty well, though they did end up running from the watch
several times.  And they mostly got paid.</p>
<p>Amusingly, my sister was not happy when they told her they'd been
fighting in a bar, so I've promised to steer closer to a “G” rating
next time…</p>

<p>If you happen to be using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html">Windows Emacs</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> there's
an annoying interaction where “M-x run-python” hangs.  The easiest way
to fix it is to mount the directory where you have your emacs
installation into the Cygwin file name structure.  For instance, I
have my emacs installation in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\emacs\emacs-22.2</span></code>, and in a
cygwin shell I did <code class="docutils literal">mount <span class="pre">-b</span> <span class="pre">‘C:\emacs'</span> /emacs</code>, and now running the
Cygwin python works.</p>
<p>The emacs function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">run-python</span></code> adds the emacs <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data-directory</span></code> to
the <code class="docutils literal">PYTHONPATH</code> in the emacs <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process-environment</span></code> before running
python; unfortunately, since this is the MS Windows emacs, its
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data-directory</span></code> starts with a drive letter and a colon.  When the
Cygwin python initializes <code class="docutils literal">sys.path</code> it splits <code class="docutils literal">PYTHONPATH</code> at the
colons, which means <code class="docutils literal">sys.path</code> ends up with the drive letter as one
component (usually interpreted as a relative path) and everything
after the colon as another component.  It that's a valid Cygwin
pathname for the Emacs data directory (which is what the above mount
command did), things work (accidentally).</p>

<p>Well worth reading, and not just as a precursor to Conan.  The essay
“Atlantean Genesis” by Patrice Louinet, included in the book, argues
on p. 288 that with the three Kull tales that were published during
Howard's life, Howard had invented a new literary subgenre: “Heroic
Fantasy”, “Epic Fantasy”, or “Swords and Sorcery” by modernizing
fantasy through eliminating “…the chivalrous aspects, the flowery language,
and stilted personalities, writing violent tales in a realistic
style…” and that seems reasonable.</p>

<p>I finally got to finish the <em>Pirates of the Spanish Main</em> one-sheet
“Dead Men Tell No Tales” that I've been running for the

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel, Captain of the Lady Faire</p></li>
<li><p>E.A. playing Alice Pettigrew</p></li>

</div>
<p>Because we've had to split the adventure up over three sessions, and
they'd finished the last one the skeletons, and I wanted a big start
to this session, I told the kids their PCs had been arguing about what
to do with the treasure and hanged lady for about an hour.  They spent
a few minutes talking about it, and then I had them make Notice rolls
to avoid being surprised by the skeletons, reanimated after an hour.
They picked up a few wounds in the fight, but managed to finish the
skeletons off.  T.A.'s bad luck with initiative cards and low rolls
continued, though not as badly as before.</p>
<p>They then tried to figure out how they could free themselves of the
curse and the skeletons, and decided the lady needed buried, which
they proceeded to do, right outside the mine entrance.  I had them
make Strength roles to avoid becoming Fatigued, which a couple of the
characters failed.  And that finished out another hour, and a few
minutes later the skeletons attacked again.  M.A. failed Scarred
Jack's Notice roll, so he didn't get dealt in the round, and got hit
by the one of the skeletons.  T.A. forgot to have Isaiah boast the
first round, and ended up owing me a bennie.  Eventually they killed
the skeletons again, and decided, since the curse obviously hadn't
been lifted, that they needed to bury the hanged lady in a cemetery at
the church in town.  Meanwhile, the weather was working up to a storm.</p>
<p>So, they dug the lady up, but in doing so T.A. and L.B. failed enough
Strength rolls to fall unconscious (remember that the curse has been
aging them rapidly), and they knew if they left the unconscious
characters there they would be killed when the skeletons reanimated,
so M.A. and E.A. had Jack and Alice pile the hanged lady's body on
Isaiah and dragged them to the town.  Unfortunately, part way through
digging the <em>new</em> grave, E.A. failed Alice's Strength roll and fell
unconscious.  Jack was able to get her most of the way out of the
grave, and finished burying the hanged lady with the six skeletons
only 20 yards away <em>and</em> the zombie pirate captain only 60 yards away.
(Apparently, the zombie pirate captain had been chasing them for days
across the bottom of the sea).  Unfortunately for our heroes, the rest
of the crew, who'd been left on the sloop offshore, picked this moment
to come ashore.  Upon seeing the sorry state of their captain and
officers (and failing their Spirit rolls, they were overcome by greed,
whacked Jack on the head with the shovels, stole the map from their
unconscious captain, and set off for the treasure.</p>
<p>The PCs awoke to a hurricane (which I'd earlier rolled using my
weather die from Flying Buffalo), and found shelter in the church
crypts.  I actually wanted to end the adventure there, but the kids
insisted we continue.</p>
<p>After a few days the weather finally subsided and they immediately
headed back to the mine to look for the treasure.  It was gone, except
for a bent half-farthing piece that had been overlooked in a crack in
the floor.  At this point they were all suffering from Fatigue from
not eating or drinking for days, and so they went back to the town to
search for water.  When T.A. failed a roll to avoid Fatigue, I ruled
he'd gone delirious, wandered out on the dock, and falling into the
water, to be washed out into the bay.  L.B. had Phelicity swim out to
save him, but by the time she reached him T.A. had failed his swimming
roll and was drowning.  Phelicity swam down and brought him to the
surface and back to shore, but he had died.  Luckily, M.A. tried to
resuscitate, and failing the first roll spent a bennie (the last
bennie among the group) to reroll, and aced well enough to overcome
the –4 penalty from drowning and the –2 penalty from being untrained
in Healing, and saved Isaiah.</p>
<p>At this point I pointed out Isaiah's consistent bad luck, loosing the
treasure, loosing his ship, and Jack's comparative good luck, and like
proper little pirates they voted Isaiah out as captain and Jack in.
After that Jack climbed some palm trees and found some weird fruit so
they could eat.  I decided that the island had <em>no</em> living creatures
at all, due to the curse, but that they could find enough edible
plants so they wouldn't starve for the weeks it would take while they
built a small boat (with both oars <em>and</em> a sail) from timber scavenged
from the houses in the village to take them off the island to begin
their search for their traitorous crew and their treasure.</p>
<p>And that's were we left them.</p>
<p>Since this actually ran pretty long, once all sessions were
considered, I gave them all 5 XP.  Not wanting T.A. to be too
discouraged, I let him trade his “Captain” edge in for something else.
I didn't let him buy off his “Cocky” Hindrance, though. <img alt="(:-)" src="images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 0.75em;">
Judging by everybody's reactions, I've got a <em>Pirates of the Spanish
Main</em> campaign to run now.  I can already see how to work the
“Smuggler's Song” one-sheet in as the next adventure.</p>
