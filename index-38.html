    <aside class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is unfinished.</p>
</aside><p>I still like plain text.  Almost <em>none</em> of the e-mail that I get that
uses HTML formatting actually gains anything from the additional
complexity.</p>
<p>Most of my writing doesn't require a 200 mebibyte word processor
installation that still can't do reasonable <em>intra</em>-document linking,
much less <em>inter</em>-document linking.  Moreover, whenever I have to use
such a beast, the conceptual overhead always gets in the way.  I
realize these may just be my own quirks, but they really make a
difference to me.</p>
<p>So, I like to do my writing in plain (or very nearly plain) text.  But
I also like having nicely printed documents, plus some hope of being
able to move from the plain text documents to something more
sophisticated on those occasions where it is warranted.  So, what do I
do?</p>
<p>I use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> (aka ReST) for writing.</p>
<p>Why both?  Well, they both have pluses and minuses.</p>
<section id="restructuredtext"><h2>reStructuredText</h2>
<p>Pros: I found reStructuredText first.  It looks pretty good as plain
text, and produces clean HTML and PDF.  It can handle deeper
structures off the bat than AsciiDoc, which is occasionally important
to me.  (Some document formats require absurdly deep levels of nested
sections.)  It can be turned into PDF using LaTeX fairly easily.</p>
<p>Cons: some of the systems I use regularly don't have good packages for
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">docutils</a>, the underlying toolset.  This may be in part because
although docutils has a long history and is pretty solid, it's still
not considered version 1.0 material.  I get the surface impression
that there are still some things that the developers are thinking
about.  And there isn't a supported <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/docbook/">DocBook</a> output format.  That's a
real shame.</p>
</section><section id="asciidoc"><h2>AsciiDoc</h2>
<p>Pros: AsciiDoc, just like reStructuredText, can go straight to HTML.
And AsciiDoc's HTML looks nicer straight out of the box.</p>
<p>AsciiDoc is also explicitly a plain-text encoding of DocBook.  This
lets you be sure you can convert it to something widely used and well
understood, which can then be converted by well-known tools into
various other formats including PDF and HTML.</p>
<p>It has better package support amongst the environments I use.</p>
<p>Cons: not as pretty looking in source form as reStructuredText.</p>
</section><section id="conclusions"><h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I wish it was easier to add special purpose structure to both AsciiDoc
and reStructuredText that can easily added to all the output formats,
for special purpose things like RPG stats or other complicated
technical documentation.</p>
<p>So, what do I do when I need something more sophisticated?  Use
<a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/docbook/">DocBook</a>, of course.</p>

    <p>The kids I game with get mentioned a lot.  Right now they're my
daughter and niece and nephews.  I'm really lucky to have such a great
bunch of kids around to play games.  (Some of the parents game
occasionally, and I'm glad to include them in the games, any time.)</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>L.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is my daughter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My brother C.P.B. and his wife C.B. live about an hour away, so their
kids get to play semi-regularly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>B.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is the oldest of the bunch, which means I've been experimenting on
him the longest.  (<img alt="(:-)" src="images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 2ex;"> I hope it hasn't hurt too
much. <img alt="(:-)" src="images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 2ex;">) His first game was a <cite>FUDGE</cite> <cite>Bunnies and Burrows</cite>
game; I think he was 5 years old then.</p>
<p>He's married and off to college now, so we don't get to game
together as much any more, alas.</p>
</dd>
<dt>D.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is the middle brother.</p>
</dd>
<dt>M.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is the youngest child, and started playing well below reading age,
so usually plays as part of a team with his dad or an older brother.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My sister C.I.A. and her husband J.W.A.II and their kids live on the
family farm, next door to me, so I get to run games for the A. kids,
along with my daughter, the most.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>T.A.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is the oldest boy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>E.A.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is his younger sister.</p>
</dd>
<dt>M.A.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is their younger brother and is the youngest of my regular gamers.
He can read now, and lots of fun playing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>C.A.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is the new baby boy, and he <a class="reference external" href="posts/2011/09/24/ff-tirpg-shaggradds-hives-of-peril-play-session-1/">recently</a> started playing in our
games.  He's very young yet, but seems to be having fun.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My brother N.A.B. and his wife K.B–B. live far out of state, and so
their kids only get to play on summer and winter vacations when they
come and visit the family farm, but I enjoy running games for them
when they are available.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>T.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is N.A.B.'s oldest son.</p>
</dd>
<dt>O.B.</dt>
<dd>
<p>is his younger brother, and started with <a class="reference external" href="pages/roleplaying-games-played-with-the-kids/#buggin">Buggin'</a>, but now
plays <cite>Savage Worlds</cite></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm going to try online gaming with a map tool and either a chat
inteface or a voice interface when the kids are a little bit older, so
the ones that are farther away can get to play more often.</p>
<p>I've run a lot of games for the kids; <em>Fudge Bunnies and Burrows</em>,
<em>BESM Dungeon</em>, <em>Toon</em>, <em>Buggin'</em>, <em>D&amp;D</em>, <em>Savage Worlds</em>, and perhaps
others.</p>

    <p>I find, when I've got little time or energy, that it is very easy to
fall back to <cite>hack-n-slash</cite> and dungeon crawling as the default types
of adventures to present for my players.  Admittedly, these days I'm
running mostly for kids who are happy to play in the intersection of
those styles.  Actual “roleplaying” happens mostly as the result of
serendipitous inspiration from in-game events (witness the

    <p>I generally carry <em>way</em> too much stuff around to games.  I'm trying to
minimize it all, and here are some ways I've found or will be trying.</p>
<p>If you are running a system that doesn't focus on battlemat-oriented
tactical play, or the evening's adventure doesn't require that style
of play, you don't probably don't have much to carry to the nights
game: maybe just a single rulebook, your notes, and your dice.</p>
<p>If you are using a battlemat and miniatures, you can cut down on what
you have to carry around.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just the core rulebook.</p>
<p>Just needing to carry one small rulebook makes things much easier.
<em>Savage Worlds: Explorer's Editon</em> and <em>Big Eyes, Small Mouth</em> score
high here, as does <em>Rules Cyclopedia</em> D&amp;D and, given the pamphlet
size and low page count of the three core books, Original D&amp;D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use flat paper figures and separate bases.</p>
<p>I've never been one for painting miniatures, unfortunately, but I
have found that part of the fun of many roleplaying games is moving
miniatures around on a battlemat.  (The kids like them too.)</p>
<p>Now that color printers that print on cardstock are cheap, paper
miniatures are practical <em>and</em> good looking.  But how do you
transport them?  It's great that they're way lighter than metal or
plastic miniatures, but if you actually cut out and glue up the
common triangle-from-the-top and triangle-from-the-side they still
take up a good bit of space, too much to take on a business trip,
for instance, and they're easily crushed.  The “T”-from-the-side
paper miniatures can sometimes be folded at the crossbar of the “T”,
but they tend to get bent when carried together. If you don't glue
the paper minatures you can carry them flat, but using paper clips
to hold them in their triangular or “T” shapes it is just too fiddly
and time consuming.</p>
<p>So, what I recently started doing was cutting out and gluing
together just the front and backs.  This gives me flat, stiff
standups that can be easily stored in an envelope, but that together
with separate plastic bases provide nice good looking 3d
miniatures.  The plastic bases themselves are sturdy and can be
transported in a small bag; even a hundred of them can fit in my
computer bag without taking much space.  And the flat standups in an
envelope travel easily without being crushed or bent.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At some point I should try counters, like Fiery Dragon's Counter
Collections, which have the complete D&amp;D 3.5E SRD monsters
covered.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put all needed opponents/monsters on index cards.</p>
<p>I recently got a printer that can print directly on cardstock and
3×5" cards, and I love being able to carry around the opponents and
deal out just the ones I need for the current encounter.  It greatly
reduces papershuffling in the middle of encounters, too, and cuts
down on the amount of junk on the table between you and the
players.  And you can carry them on in a shirt pocket on a pinch.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't forget stock opponents.</p>
<p>Having a collection of stock opponents to fall back on really
helps.  Sometimes just shuffling the 3×5" cards gives me ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Flip Mats and dry-erase markers for battlemats</p>
<p>I got two of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.steelsqwire.com/">Steel Sqwire</a>'s original Flip-Mat™ battlemats.
They've got 1 inch squares on one side and 1 inch hexes on the other
side, and they fold up flat to 8×10 inches and unfolded are 24×30
inches.  Two of these fit in my computer bag without bulking it up
noticably, and work wonderfully with dry-erase pens.  (No more
stains from wet-erase remains!)  The only problems is that since
they fold, they have creases, and don't lay pefectly flat.  However,
I've used these with paper miniatures and unless someone slaps
something down in the middle of mat or really jars the table things
are pretty stable and the miniatures don't fall down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Printed Cardstock Tile Terrain instead of battlemats</p>
<p>I recently bought a bunch of PDF printable terrain tiles from
Skeleton Key Games.  They make nice looking terrain and they are all
standardized shapes that I can print on cardstock on an inexpensive
inkjet printer and cut out.  Since they're all the same size and
shape they stack flat and since they're cardstock you can easily
carry them in a standard 6½x9½ manilla envelope, and two or three
envelopes easily carry enough for an evening's play.  The
disadvantages are that tiles sometimes curve, which tends to lead to
the tiles moving around more as they're laid and played on.</p>
<p>As a side node, the various tile sets published by Wizards of the
Coast for use with D&amp;D, Star Wars, and the associated miniatures
battle games have a great graphical appears and are very heavy,
sturdy solid cardboard (not corragated), so they make a great
battlemat.  Unfortunately, they're all different sizes which makes
it difficult to pack them compactly, and the thick cardboard which
makes them so stable in play also makes them surprisingly bulky.
(And I can never figure out easily if I've actually collected up all
the pieces after the game.)</p>
<p>2008-08-20 01:29:26: I'm still undecided as to whether these are
slower and less convenient than the Flip-Mats.  They do look neat,
though.</p>

    <p>I've been using the DocBook Website customization to build my website
since the beginning.</p>
<p>First I used the DSSSL stylesheets to built it.  They built the
website as a single SGML (and later XML) document from multiple input
files included into a main organizing file that produced multiple HTML
output files, checking all the cross references and building a site
map.  Unfortunately, this method stopped working in my environment for
some reason, and I never had time to figure out why.</p>
<p>I thought I'd see how the XSL stylesheets the DocBook Website
customization worked.  The architecture for the Website customization
changed between the two: now the website was multiple documents, each
built from an XML input file and producing an HTML output file, and
using the DocBook XSL stylesheet <code class="docutils literal">olink</code> cross-document linking for
links between the different pages.  This necessitated changing all the
source files, but even more unfortunately the processing of cross
document links consumed so much memory that rebuilding the site took
forever, and eventually got to the point where it used more memory
than was usually available on my server.  (Admittedly, my setup was
atypical for DocBook, and perhaps even pathological.)</p>
<p>In disgust, I let my site lie fallow, waiting for some better solution
to present itself. Alas, nothing was immediately forthcoming.  I
really like DocBook for markup, and the “correct” solution would
probably be to take <a class="reference external" href="http://norman.walsh.name">Norm Walsh</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://norman.walsh.name/2003/05/14/how">route</a> and custom-build some DocBook
to website software, but frankly I haven't had the time or energy to
do that, especially since, if I follow Norm's <a class="reference external" href="http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/16/build">example</a>, I'd have to
take the time to figure out RDF and so forth.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided that I'd try something minimal: adding a new
<a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io">blog</a> using <a class="reference external" href="http://pybloxsom.sourceforge.net">pyBloxsom</a>, which seemed simple enough to be
comprehendable.  It supported <a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, one of the nicer
<a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/07/08/plain-text-markup/">plaintext</a> markup systems, which was a definite bonus <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/07/07/website-construction/#simple" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.
After fiddling around about I got enough for a reasonably comfortable
minimalist blog.  So, give it a look-see.</p>

<p>I hate most WYSIWYG software, and am hoping that using
reST regularly for the blog will be lightweight enough that I won't
notice the burden.</p>

<p>Smuggler's Cove, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/">PEG</a></p>
</aside><p>Saturday after the 4th I ran another <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/">Savage Worlds</a> game for the
<a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a>.  This time it was “The Secret of Smuggler's Cove”, lightly
adapted for the <em>Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition</em>.</p>

<li><p>M.A., playing Devlin</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="actual-play"><h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p>The PCs in this adventure are all kids, and T.A. wasn't any too happy
that none of the characters had any weapons more effective than a
slingshot!  Still, they all had fun with the first two sections of the
adventure.  In the first they raced small sailboats, and they managed
to split the characters up so that all the characters run by the two
boys were in one boat and all the characters run by the two girls were
in the other boat, and each had fun taunting and distracting the
others.  I ran it as a chase and let good taunts and distractions
affect the <em>Boating</em> rolls of the two captains, and I let every
<em>success</em> and <em>raise</em> on the <em>Boating</em> roll move the boat one range
increment forward <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2008/07/05/smugglers-cove-2008-07-05/#chase-and-ranges" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, which may not be strictly by
the book, but did allow for dramatic changes in position.  The girls
won on the last <em>Boating</em> roll, and then it was time to eat a picnic
lunch.  They observed the thug hide the map and papers, dug them up,
figured out the notes were in German, reburied them, followed the man
who picked them up back to Rydel Mount &amp; figured out that he was the
gardener, headed back home (very, very, late), saw the Gypsies cooking
fire beyond the old Roman fort &amp; traipsed over to see what was
happening.</p>
<!-- There are notes on what bennies each character has in my “Current
Gaming” notebook.  I have no idea where the character sheets and
figure flats are, though. -->
