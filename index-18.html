got it from the Salem College library as a youngster one snowy winter
day when I'd gone there with my Dad (who was a professor there at the

<h2>Oracle</h2>
<p>It turns out that to install Oracle 10g on a Windows XP machine that
doesn't have a static address or which is not connected to a network
you have to install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter, configure it with
a non-routable IP address, make it the primary network address, and
make sure oracle uses that address when it installs. This is
documented in this <a class="reference external" href="http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/html/B10132_02/toc.htm#CACCBEJJ">version of the release notes</a> but
unfortunately, this is <em>not</em> the current version of the release notes,
so if you follow the normal links on their website or you look at the
relase notes that come with the download you won't see that section.</p>
<p>Just for posterity, here's what Oracle has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10.22 Prerequisite for DHCP Installation</p>
<p>To install Oracle Database or Oracle Database 10g Companion Products
on a server configured with DHCP, or if you want to perform an off-
network installation and connect to the network afterwards, then you
must appropriately configure the Microsoft Loopback adapter as the
primary network interface before installation.</p>
<p>Follow this procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Install Microsoft Loopback adapter on the DHCP computer.  See Also:
Microsoft Knowledge Base documentation for instructions on installing
and configuring the Loopback adapter</p></li>
<li><p>After installing the adapter, you must assign it a non-routable IP.
The following values are recommended: 192.168.x.x (where x is any
value) and 10.10.10.10. Then assign a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Modify <code class="docutils literal">System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> to include an entry of the
form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">;non-routable IP Fully-Qualified-Windows-Machine-Name Windows-Machine-Name-Aliases</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">10.10.10.10 oracle-laptop.us.oracle.com oracle-laptop</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Windows considers Loopback adapters as a type of network adapter.
After installing the Loopback adapter, you have at least two network
adapters on your computer: your network adapter and the Loopback
adapter. You want Windows to use the loopback adapter as the primary
adapter. Check your operating system documentation for instructions on
how to do this.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You must set up the Loopback adaptor before installation.</p>

<li>
<p><em>Masters of Fantasy</em>, edited by Bill Fawcett and Brian Tomsen; Baen,
2004.  I think this book is misnamed: I think it includes works by
only two “Masters” (Norton and Foster, though each are more masters
of space opera in the non-pejorative sense, especially Foster) and
several who are potentially “Masters”, along with a lot of extruded
fantasy product.  In practical terms, I only <em>liked</em> the stories by
Norton, Asprin &amp; Nye, Drake, Moon, and Weber. Several of the others
were competently written, and the rest were extruded fantasy
product. (Foster is definitely a “Master” of space opera, and I've
liked his <em>Spellslinger</em> tales in the past, but this one did nothing
for me.)</p>
<p>In the Introduction Thomsen talks about the difference
between “category” fiction (he explicitly calls “category” a
pejorative) and “genre” fiction. As far as I can tell, the
difference is that “category” fiction's main venues for sales were
the drug store and gas station (and probably, though he doesn't say
this, the supermarket) wire racks and the fact that they sold
relatively few copies, while “genre” fiction sold well and was
respected by the publisher and bookseller and was treated as
essentially a normal fiction book. Thomsen attributes the publishers'
and booksellers' current “respect” for fantasy entirely to
fantasy's ability to produce best sellers, and to this respect
attributes the existence of the numerous small publishers specializing
in the genre.</p>
<p>Frankly, I disagree. The publishing industry's
“respect”, as always, is for bestsellers only, because they make
the most money for the publisher, and they're perfectly happy to
discard authors who are profitable but not bestellers. That's why
there has been an increase in small publishers: they are the only ones
willing to publish these profitable but not bestselling authors. The
big publishers are more interested in gambling on who will produce the
next bestseller, so they publish new authors and drop them unless they
produce bestsellers. That's why the size if a print run for a typical
fantasy book are smaller now than in the mid 70s: print a few, see if
it becomes a best seller, and if not, don't print any more, regardless
of whether it was profitable or not. Go for the pot of gold at the end
of the bestseller rainbow and ignore the profitable small business
along the side road.</p>

<li><p><em>Kothar and the Wizard Slayer</em>, by Gardner F. Fox; Unibook/Modern

another of Fox's books if I ran across it, but I wouldn't search them
out.</p></li>

safety of a well-run modern legal system; well worth rereading.</p></li>

published as <em>Tehanu: the last book of Earthsea</em>.  When <em>Tehanu</em> was
first released there was a lot of controversy amongst those who
remembered the first three * Earthsea* books fondly because where
the first three were beloved children's/young adult books about
(among other things) coming of age and choices, <em>Tehanu</em> is about
(among other things) child abuse and gender/power
relationships. Many felt that Le Guin had used the popularity of the
earlier three books as a springboard for a polemic. I recently
reread the three earlier books and the fourth in fairly close
proximity, and in my considered opinion the fourth book has the same
voice as the earlier three: it's definitely an <em>Earthsea</em> book.  I
was glad to find, <a class="reference external" href="posts/2003/07/03/2003-07-03-gtkada-reading/#more-earthsea-tales">a while ago</a>, that there <em>were</em> more <em>Earthsea</em>

adult to deal with the death of his father and the overwhelming and
smothering benevolence of his kindly uncle Ebeneezer, along with a
number of unpleasant murders of young girls in mid-19th century
London. Despite my expectations and a really alarming verbosity I
ended up rather enjoying this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Drumbeat</em>, by Dudley Pope, copyright 1968; Pocket Books, 1970.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ramage's Diamond</em>, by Dudley Pope, copyright 1976; Avon Books,
January 1982.  I've enjoyed what I've read so far of Pope's <em>Ramage</em>
books, and was happy to find this one in a local library, along with a
number of other volumes in the series.</p></li>

<h2>Additions on Tuesday, 21 April 2009</h2>
<p>I thought I'd better quote what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, I've been skeptical about hygiene for the past six or
seven years.  The hygiene algorithm struck me as such an obviously
good idea that I simply couldn't understand what the MIT folks meant
when they said (and I'm paraphrasing, loosely, from papers I haven't
read in a decade) that the hygiene algorithm doesn't make sense.  Only
a few years ago did I begin to unravel this, and now I almost entirely
understand it.  In short, it has taken me nearly a decade to
understand why someone did not understand something that I understood
obviously, and it's only because what I understood obviously, I now
barely understand at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really simple to understand how to implement <code class="docutils literal">defmacro</code>.  It's
not simple to understand how to implement <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syntax-case</span></code>.  Throw in
modules, as in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme</a> (and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a>, apparently), and things are
even more difficult.  Throw in the oddity of writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syntax-case</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syntax-rules</span></code> macros with the pattern matching syntax, and you
really have to wonder.</p>
<p>I really wish somebody would sit down and write detailed survey
article comparing all the Lisp and Scheme macro systems and
considering all the interactions with modules and pattern matching.  I
think it's really needed.  [Do I say this somewhere else, too?]</p>

<h2>Goodbye, PM3</h2>
<p>I have been cleaning some uncessary packages off <code class="docutils literal">tkb.mpl.com</code> and in
the process accidently deleted <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pm3-forms</span></code>, a GUI library for the
Polytechnic Modula 3 implementation (PM3). Unfortunately, CVSup uses
the forms library, and I use CVSup extensively to keep the FreeBSD
source code and Ports up to date, so I can keep <code class="docutils literal">tkb.mpl.com</code> up to
date. Unfortunately, I'd built PM3 back in the XFree86 days and have
since switched to Xorg and the dependencies in the other PM3 packages
would have caused rebuilding and reinstalling all the XFree86
packages. I had no desire to go back there, so I decided to delete all
the PM3 packages and CVSup and rebuild CVSup from scratch. Upon
consideration, I decided to use the ezm3 Modula 3 distribution instead
of PM3 ; the ezm3 distribution is specifically maintined to support
<code class="program docutils literal">CVSup</code>, and since that's the only thing I'm using Modula 3 for any
more it makes sense to use the smaller but better maintained ezm3
instead of the bigger and more featureful but almost unmaintained PM3
distribution.</p>
<p>It's really a pity: the PM3 distribution had a lot of neat programs
included and Modula 3 is very interesting language and was used as the
building blocks for a lot of very interesting research, but today the
user base is too small to see much development with the language.
Personally, I think it has a lot going for it: it's a relatively small
language with a great number of features that showed up in other
languages of its kind only later: garbage collection, modules,
threads, objects, generics, and so on, in a very readable and
understandable way. In many ways it's a better language than many of
its successors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for my personal use, it doesn't go quite far enough in
one way: I've been spoiled by the convenience of higher level
languages like Dylan, Lisp, Scheme, and Objective Caml; and in another
way it has gone a little too far: interfacing to C is well defined,
but is not without some easily overlooked drawbacks. The situation was
not improved by the minor but pervasive incompatiblities between
classic Modula 3 on one side (the original DEC distribution, PM3, and
ezm3) and the enhanced version produced by Critical Mass (CM3). In
the end, it remains a language that, like Oberon-2 and Ada, I like,
but not enough to use regularly.</p>

<h2>Recent Reading (Harlan)</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Wasteland of Flint</em>, by Thomas Harlan; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
LLC, April 2003.  I devoured Harlan's earlier <em>Oath of Empire</em>, a
fascinating fantasy set in an alternate Roman Empire, so I was
overjoyed to find he has started a new series, beginning with this
book. This time it's science fiction, but again it's alternate
history, set in the future in a universe where the Aztec empire rules
Earth and has expanded to the stars. It's a good book that kept me
interested to the last and looking forward to the next book in the
series, <em>House of Reeds</em>.</p></li>
