<p>I saw Iron Man a while back, before I saw <em>Batman: the Dark Knight</em>.
I actually read Iron Man decades ago as a preteen and teen, but can't
claim any more than a casual acquaintance.  In any case, I ended up
liking the movie.   It didn't make some of the mistakes I thought it might.  I'm looking forwarad to the sequel.</p>
<p>I don't see many movies in the theatres any more.  I ought to keep
better track of which ones I've seen.</p>

<p>This was the second, and concluding, session in T.A.'s Savage Worlds
game.  L.B. was in from Kentucky and B.B. and D.B. were down from
Morgantown, so along with T.A., E.A., and M.A. we had a full table.
Moreover, M.B., who is B.B. and D.B.'s much younger brother, also
wanted to play.  He's a bit too young to understand how the game
works, though, so it was a bit frustrating for him and the others.  We
worked through it and it turned out ok.</p>
<p>T.A. GMed.  E.A. played Eureka, the healer.  L.B. played Alisia, an
archer.  D.B. played Surt, the combat mage.  I played Loki, the sneaky
guy, sharing him with M.B..  M.A. played Ragnar, the wizard.  and
B.B. played Fritz, an archer.</p>
<p>We decided we had gone back to town after the previous session and
picked up a couple of friends.  We easily finished off the rest of the
goblin clan, picking up a couple more invented-on-the-spot magic
items.  We continued to have it in for the dire wolves, and Ragnar
exploded a couple of them with his magic.  The villagers were glad to
be freed from the goblin raiding and gladly paid us as they had
promised.</p>

<p>I liked the movie a lot.  I'd rate it at 4 stars, possibly higher.  I
was never bored during the movie, and it didn't feel too long to me.
I thought the violence was appropriate for the Joker.  There <em>were</em>
too many false endings.</p>
<p>There were two particular things about the movie that I didn't like.</p>
<p>First, and of less importantance, I don't think there was enough
development of Harvey Dent's psyche to make his actions at the end
believable.  For me to believe that, I think the viewer (though not
Gotham's populace, obviously) has to be made aware that Dent has some
serious psychological problems which in the end cause him to crack and
become seriously insane.  I think the coin-flipping in the first part
of the movie is not enough, because the coin-toss is <em>fixed</em>.  I don't see
enough of his pysche to see how he goes from the completely non-random
fixed coin to actually letting the now blackened coin randomly decide
the fate of innocent children.  Mobsters, yes; innocent children who
could not possibly be to blame, no.  At first I wasn't convinced that
his going after Gordon and Batman and letting the Joker go was
plausible, either, but I can understand how Dawes's death and their
involvement in it could send him after Gordon and Batman, and if he's
going to be consistent about the coin I can barely see him letting the
Joker off.  But after Gordon's family?  No.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, I think having Batman and Gordon decide
for Batman to take the blame for the death of those Dent killed (and
Dent?) plays into the tendency of governments and officials to lie to
its citizens "to keep them safe" and in particular to lie to them
because the government doesn't believe they can deal with the horrible
truth.  I'm not convinced that Batman would really believe that the
citizens of Gothom City would be so traumatized by Dent's breakdown
and madness that the city would be seriously impaired, and that even
if he did I'm not convinced that he would see it as the correct
course.  Lying to the public "to keep them safe" just makes the public
powerless, and I think Batman isn't about making the public powerless,
he's about protecting them when their normal protections aren't
working, for whatever reason.  He's not going to keep the public weak
just because he likes being a vigilante, he's going to help make them
strong.</p>
<p>I've read Batman comics and I own the Batman RPG (it was sort of an
intro to the Mayfair DC Heroes game) though I've never played it, but
I'm in no way a Batman scholar, so I may be misinterpreting things, or
perhaps it's just that Batman has varied so much over the years that
you can find support for any view, but this is what Batman looks like
to me.  I don't see Batman deciding to take the blame for those
murders just to coddle the public.</p>
<p>Now, the whole idea of the perviously adoring public turning against
Batman does lead the story into interesting places, but I think that
this could easily happen anyway.  For instance, if a a charismatic
reporter or official carries on a campaign emphasising the negative
aspects of Batman's vigilantism - can you say "collateral damage"? - I
could easily see the crowd turning against Batman.  (Although that
might have too many echos of Peter Parker and J. Jonah Jamison.)  But
I think some other plausible method could have been found.</p>

<p>I think that one of the main problems with U.S. elections is that in
many cases we don't actually have much choice.  The way that
U.S. elections are organized it is very difficult to vote for anyone
other than a Republican or a Democrat.  In many states getting on the
ballot is difficult for other parties, and even in the states where
it's easier the whole structure is set up to favour the Democrats and
Replublicans.</p>
<p>To fix this we need to level the playing field by making it easier for
alternative parties to get on the ballot, ensure that anybody can vote
for anybody on the ballot in the primaries without penalty —
regardless of political affiliation, allow the citizens to vote
<em>against</em> particular politicians, and eliminate the ability of
political parties to select candidates that contradict the popular
vote.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>T.A. has been coming up with maps and ideas for roleplaying games for
a while now, and earlier this week while we were talking about RPGs he
said he had a Savage Worlds game he wanted to run.  I suggested we do
it today, Saturday, in the afteroon, and that's what we did.</p>
<p>His sister E.A. and brother M.A were the only ones of the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a>
around, and they both wanted to play.  We decided to play outside, at
a small picnic table in the shade, on top of a large blanket so
dropped dice would be easy to find.  (T.A.'s idea, and a very good
one.)  It took a while to get everything set up, and the kids were a
little impatient; I can't blame them.  But we finally got going.  I
brought up my Savage Worlds GM Screen and my Flip-Mats and dry-erase
pens.  E.A. and I got an extra benny each for shuffling cards, and
M.A. got a benny for helping set up the table.</p>
<p>T.A. had made several pregenerated characters, so we had a good
selection to choose from.  E.A. went for a healer again, M.A. picked a
wizard, and I picked out a theif and combat mage.  E.A. came up with a
name for her character, Eureka, but M.A. was stuck, so I asked if he
wanted help, and he did.  We ended up naming his wizard Ragnar, so I
stuck with that for a theme and named my thief Loki and my fire-themed
combat mage Surt.</p>
<p>T.A. had made a map of a cavern/dungeon and decided on the monster
stats and locations, but beyond that hadn't written anything down.  He
had thought about what he wanted a lot, though, and had it all in his
head.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actual-play">
<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p>T.A. told us that our characters had seen notices posted that a small,
nearby village was seeking adventurers to help with deal with goblin
raiders.  A short time later were were talking with the headman of the
village, who after some talking promised us 50 gp each in advance and
another 50 gp each after the job was done.  A short time later we were
headed out to the trail the goblins took after their raids.</p>
<p>The trail eventually lead up to the base of a hill and an cavern
entrance.</p>
<p>E.A. aced Eureka's Notice roll as we snuck into the entrance and
noticed something weird about the wall.  It turned out to be a secret
door, leading down a short passage and through another secret door
into a room with a giant spider just settling down for a nap.
Luckily, Loki had eased the 2nd secret door open quietly, so Ragnar
tried to cast a Bolt at the spider.  Unfortunately, M.A. rolled snake
eyes (ones on both his Spellcasting and his Wild Die), and woke the
spell up.  Next round he spent a benny to get rid of the shaken and
aced his Spellcasting roll, aced the damage roll, and so much for the
spider.</p>
<p>After that we worked our way through a guardroom and a kitchen, each
with goblins and dire wolves.  As it turned out, the guards had
screamed loud enough for the cook to hear something, but we sent in
Ragnar in rat form and he saw the layout of the room and reported back
to us.  We burst in the door, catching the dire wolf with it and
stunning it.  The cook died fast, but the dire wolf took forever to
kill due to some really lucky rolls.  We had it stunned at least 3
times, but could never land another until Surt got the Joker, took a
multi-action penalty to cast the spell smite and attack in the same
round and aced his Spellcasting roll, killing the dire wolf with one
massive blow.  He immediately set about skinning the wolf, to take the
hide back and have it tanned.  And that's were we stopped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reflections">
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>T.A. did several neat things.  Whenever a PC made a <strong>really</strong> good
search roll and found something magical, T.A. rolled to see which PC
the magic item would best suit, then made up a nifty magic item on the
spot for that character.  The healer got a Staff of Healing that
couldn't be used for attacking, but would give the healer a bonus on
any healing related roll.  The combat mage ended up with a longsword
that added a bonus to the damage for his Smite power.  Later, when
Surt wanted the hide of the dire wolf that he finally killed after it
had given the party a long fight, T.A. said that when it was tanned it
would give him +1 Armor to attacks from the back.  Neither the rolling
for who the magic item would suit nor the making up the magic items on
the spot was anything he'd seen me do, but it worked well, he came up
with nifty magic items that weren't overpowering, and it was neat: no
boring “you find a +1 sword” here.  In some ways I think it was very
“Old School”, in a good way.  (I'll talk about “Old School” some other
time.)</p>

<p>Ok, suppose you want to evaluate a particular bit of code
after emacs loads a particular emacs-lisp file, but you want to pass
values of local variables into that code.  The function
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval-after-load</span></code> makes you quote the expression and doesn't
allow passing values into the expression.  How about this?</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><code>(require 'cl)
(defmacro* eval-after-load* (file varlist &amp;rest body)
  "Like `eval-after-load', but bind variables according to VARLIST in
the current environment of the `eval-after-load' expression, not the
environment when BODY is evaluated.  This allows easy passing of values
into BODY.
Each element of VARLIST is a symbol (which is bound to the current value
of that symbol) or a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) (which binds SYMBOL to the
value of VALUEFORM in the environment of the `eval-after-load' expression."
  `(eval-after-load ,file
     '(let ,(loop for v in varlist
                  collect (if (symbolp v)
                              `(,v ,(eval v))
                            `(,(car v) ,(eval (cadr v))))
                  into new-varlist
                  finally return new-varlist) ,@body)))
(put 'eval-after-load* 'lisp-indent-function
     (1+ (get 'eval-after-load 'lisp-indent-function)))</code></pre>
<p>Here's a contrived example which demonstrates when things happen.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><code>(let ((f (make-temp-file "tkb-madness" nil ".el"))
      (x 1))
  (unwind-protect
      (progn
        (save-excursion
          (let ((buf (find-file f)))
            (insert (format "(y-or-n-p \"In the file '%s'! \")" f))
            (save-buffer)
            (kill-buffer buf)))
        (y-or-n-p "This happens before the eval-after-load*")
        (eval-after-load* f
            (x
             (y (y-or-n-p "This happens when the eval-after-load* is executed?"))
             (z 2))
          (y-or-n-p (format "x: %d y: %S z: %d" x y z))
          (y-or-n-p "This happends during the delayed expressions"))
        (y-or-n-p "This happens after the eval-after-load* expression")
        (load f))
    (when (file-exists-p f) (delete-file f))))</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><code>Wrote /tmp/tkb-madness88647vuE.el
This happens before the eval-after-load*(y or n)
This happens when the eval-after-load* is executed?(y or n)
This happens after the eval-after-load* expression(y or n)
Loading /tmp/tkb-madness88647vuE.el (source)...
In the file '/tmp/tkb-madness88647vuE.el'! (y or n)
x: 1 y: t z: 2(y or n)
This happends during the delayed expressions(y or n)
Loading /tmp/tkb-madness88647vuE.el (source)...done</code></pre>
<p>(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y-or-n-p</span></code> is used instead of <code class="docutils literal">message</code> so you see each message when it
happens.)</p>
<p>Does the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval-after-load*</span></code> macro make sense?</p>

<p>Ever use the emacs command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">describe-char</span></code>?  It's even more fun with
proper unicode lookup data!</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><code>;; First, we'll bind it to a key.
(global-set-key "\C-cD" #'describe-char)

;; Now we'll download it if necessary.

      (udf-dest "~/tmp/UnicodeData.txt"))
  (if (file-readable-p udf-dest)
      ;; Let describe-char know it exists.
      (setq describe-char-unicodedata-file udf-dest)
    ;; It doesn't exist, and we need to download it!
    (when (y-or-n-p (format "You need to download %s ! Do it? " udf-url))
      ;; Really weird: wget -O 'file' complains that file doesn't exist.
      (let* ((cmd (format "cd ~/tmp/ &amp;&amp; wget -O %s --progress=dot '%s'"
                          udf-dest udf-url))
             (buf (get-buffer-create (format " *wget '%s'*" udf-url)))
             (proc (start-process-shell-command "wget-unicode-Data"

<p>Once this is run and it tells you to try <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">describe-char</span></code> you can
position your cursor over one of the Unicode characters in the message
(“C-h e” to display the “<em>Messages</em>” buffer) and press “C-cD” and look
for the “Name:” line.  You'll see something like this:</p>
