Do you like D&D 5E, but would like to have it with with point-based
character generation, effects-based rules, and an Anime
flavour?  Well *Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy
Role-Playing Adventures* is what you want.

My physical copies of *Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy Role-Playing
Adventures* (`home page`_, Kickstarter_, and `DriveThruRPG page`_)
from `Dyskami Publishing Company`_ and `Mark C. MacKinnon`_ came
today, and I have only had a chance to briefly skim the pocket edition,
but I'm pleased at what they managed to fit into the small package of
384 pages and a physical size of 12.5cm wide × 18.9cm tall × 2.25cm
think (4 15/16in wide × 7 13/32in tall × 27/32in think) and still have
the text be large enough to read.

While I agree that adding the flexibility of Dynamic Powers attribute
as magic (p. 154) is very interesting I would like to have seen a
little guidance for using the rest of the attributes as spells using
the Deplete limiter (p. 237) and the optional Energy rules (p. 280),
which I've seen used very well in BESM (BESM1_, BESM2_).

I'll have to wait until I get a chance to peruse the hardback version
to comment on the art.

Later: I just have to add: **OMG! Battle Cabbits!** (On p. 367.) So
cute!
