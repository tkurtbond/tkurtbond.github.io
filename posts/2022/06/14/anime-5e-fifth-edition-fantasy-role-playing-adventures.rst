Do you like D&D 5E, but would like to have it with with point-based
character generation, effects-based rules, and an Anime
flavour?  Well *Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy
Role-Playing Adventures* is what you want.

My physical copies of *Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy Role-Playing
Adventures* (`home page`_, Kickstarter_, and `DriveThruRPG page`_)
from `Dyskami Publishing Company`_ and `Mark C. MacKinnon`_ came
today, and I have only had a chance to briefly skim the pocket
edition, but I'm pleased at what they managed to fit into the small
package of 384 pages and a physical size of approximately 12.5cm wide
× 18.9cm tall × 2.25cm thick (4 15/16in wide × 7 13/32in tall ×
27/32in thick) and still have the text be large enough to read.

While I agree that adding the flexibility of Dynamic Powers attribute
as magic (p. 154) is very interesting I would like to have seen a
little guidance for using the rest of the attributes as spells using
the Deplete limiter (p. 237) and the optional Energy rules (p. 280);
I've seen the similar rules in BESM (BESM1_, BESM2_) used very well.

I'll have to wait until I get a chance to peruse the hardback version
to comment on the art.

Later: I just have to add: **OMG! Battle Cabbits!** (On p. 367.) So
cute!  Now, if they only turned into spaceships as well...

I also liked the Items chapter, especially the “Ring of Power”.
