Anybody interested in an SRD for *Mini Six*? Since *Mini Six* is under
the Open Game License, I have created one for it, `Minimal
OpenD6 <https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6>`__. (It does
**not** include the Product Identity portions, of course.)

If you just want to read the rules I still think the original `Mini Six:
Bare Bones
Edition <https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144558/Mini-Six-Bare-Bones-Edition>`__
is a great document, packing so much into a dense but readable layout,
so download it for free or get a print copy. However, if you want a
custom version of the rules, whether you are producing a completely new
game or just want a version of the rules with all your house rules
incorporated, this should be a great starting point.

Why start with *Minimal OpenD6* instead of of *OpenD6*? Because you want
to start with a minimal core and add things gradually, rather than
starting with a very large document and cutting out everything you don’t
want! (Different approaches work better for different folks.)

*Minimal OpenD6* provides
`reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__ source
for the document, as well as simple PDF, HTML, EPUB, Microsoft Word
``.docx``, OpenOffice/LibreOffice ``.odt``, and Markdown output.
Conversions to other formats are possible using
`pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`__ or other means.

If you just want the output files without any of the stuff used to build
them, look at the
`releases <https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6/releases>`__ page
in the repository for a zip file.
