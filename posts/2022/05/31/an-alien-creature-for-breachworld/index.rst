Here's an alien creature that created to have come through a nearby
Breach in the `Breachworld Adventure Folio #1 - The Big Score`__ for
the `Breachworld RPG`_ from `Jason Richards Publishing`__ when I ran
that for my players.

I used `The Random Esoteric Creature Generator for Classic Fantasy
Role-Playing Games and Their Modern Simulacra`__ to get inspiration
for the creature.  It wasn't hard to mung that into something for the
`Breachworld RPG`_, which uses `Mini Six`_ as the base for its rules.
It should be easy to convert to any other OpenD6 game.

Dragonfly
---------

The creature is huge, as big as an elephant.  It is semi-humanoid, having the head and wings of a immense dragonfly, two pairs of arms, a pair of legs, and a segmented body part coming out of the base of its spine that ends in a long stinger.  It has three sets of mandibles for chewing.  It is covered by chitinous armor.  Its eyes glow blue, and its body is dark red on the head and torso, fading to a lighter red along its extremities.
