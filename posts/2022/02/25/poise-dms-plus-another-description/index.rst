I found a better description of the POISE DMS-Plus; alas, the original
link_ is broken now, but it is still accessible from `archive.org`_
here_.  It is from the time when POISE was still owned by Campus
America, but they seem to had added a Tulsa to the end of the name,
and I don't remember that version of the company.  Oh, I forgot to
mention that the POISE DMS-Plus runs on OpenVMS.  I use it on VAX/VMS
v5.5-2 on an emulated VAX that I maintain.

I'll quote it below in it's entirety:

    **DMS-Plus®**

    DMS-Plus is a 4GL (fourth generation language) with its own database
    management system that is the foundation of POISE application software
    systems. POISE PRODUCTSistrative software applications and DMS-Plus run
    under the OpenVMS operating system on Compaq’sVAX families and Alpha
    computers.

    DMS-Plus offers the freedom to choose where control of the
    PRODUCTSistrative system should be depending on your institution’s
    needs. Control may be given to a central data processing center, or
    departments may be autonomous.

    The benefits of a DMS-Plus approach to PRODUCTSistrative processing
    include greater flexibility and speed, and simplicity in implementing
    changes. Users have the freedom to organize, access, and manipulate
    information to meet their needs, freeing the data processing center to
    become a more flexible and responsive information and resource center.

    *Features*

    DMS-Plus provides the following capabilities and productivity tools:

    -  Report Generators for easy sorting, selecting, and printing.
    -  Screen Generators for easy data entry, update, and review
    -  PRODUCTSistrative Systems Query (ASQ) for retrieving data from the
       database using English-like commands.
    -  Menu Processor
    -  Data Manipulation for inserting, updating, and deleting data in the
       database
    -  Data Definition for adding new elements to the database
    -  Data Control for accessing data by persons who have been granted
       access
    -  Import/Export capability via ASCII file formats
    -  WordPerfect Interface

    Oracle Rdb for Open VMS and Open Alpha AXP commuting environments. In
    addition, it incorporates industry standards such as SQL. By including
    support for Oracle Rdb in POISE application software, Campus America
    provides investment protection. You may take advantage of new and
    sophisticated features while continuing to use the 4 GL tools of
    DMS-Plus.

    *Housing*

    DMS-Plus includes a wide range of reporting tools that can produce both
    ad hoc and routine reports. These tools include a columnar report
    writer, a forms writer, a label printing program, and an English-like
    query language.

    All tools are designed for the everyday user and may be used without the
    help of a programming staff. These tools include on-line help.

    DMS-Plus provides a set of tools to establish databases and to
    manipulate the data within them. Simple steps for the use of DMS-Plus
    are shown below:

    - Step 1: Create a database, DMS-Plus DESCRIBE is used to create a
      database. When the database is created, it is empty. Records may be
      added to it by any of several DMS-Plus functions: SCOPE, ADD,
      TRANSFER, etc.

    - Step 2: Use the database. After records(data) are added in one or
      more databases, you perform the following procedures:

      * Query the database
      * Generate reports
      * Post (move / update) data from one database to another
      * Perform calculations on data in the database
      * Exercise various combinations of the above actions
      * Print labels, personalized letters, reports, etc.

    - Step 3: Continue manipulating data. New records may be added, old
      records may be deleted, and / or data within existing records may be
      updated. Operations in Step 2 may be repeated.

    In summary, after a database has been created, you may devote your
    attention to adding, updating, and manipulating data for specific
    purposes. If necessary, field descriptions in the data base may be
    changed or new fields added. Also, the number and size is included in
    the database may be increased if the need arises.
