* `A Matter of Oaths`, by Helen S. Wright; copyright 1990;
  ISBN 0-445-20983-6.

  I saw this recommended on the Internet somewhere, in August or July
  probably, and bought a copy used.  It was good.  Then, in the end of
  September or the 1st or 2nd of October I was looking in boxes of
  books in my garage, and say I already owned a copy.  I can't say I
  remember the contents, so I may have just never read it before now.
