As I've mentioned before_, I've been planning to use the RPGs derived
from the `Fighting Fantasy` gamebooks for pickup games with the kids_,
today we continued with the second adventure from `Fighting Fantasy —
The Introductory Role-playing Game` (FF:TIRpG), `Shaggradd's Hives of
Peril`.

Actual Play
===========

Amber introduced herself as **Judy** for some reason.  (The player did
this deliberately.  I have no idea why.)

Started in `1`:area:, went to `19`:area:, then `22`:area:.  They
skinned the weretiger.  On to `23`:area:, `13`:area:, `14`:area:.
Finally Lettie looked in `18`:area: and then the door shut.


Reflections
===========

The kids were giddy, and the game didn't last very long, alas.  No
doubt the chaos contributed to my inability to take good notes this
session.
