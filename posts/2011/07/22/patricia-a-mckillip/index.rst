* `The Forgotten Beasts of Eld`, by Patricia A. McKillip,
  copyright 1974; ISBN 0-425-06595-2.

  This was the first book by Patricia A. McKillip that I remember
  reading, I think, and though it was `The Riddlemaster of Hed` that
  really confirmed McKillip as my favorite author at the time, this
  book certainly contributed to my liking.  I find McKillip's writing
  lyrical and her settings evocative.
