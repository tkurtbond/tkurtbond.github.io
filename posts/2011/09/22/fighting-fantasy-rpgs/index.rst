I missed out…
=============

Somehow I completely missed out on the `Fighting Fantasy`:series (|FF|)
gamebooks during their initial run.  Probably, since I was already
playing |AD&D|, |T&T|, and |DQ|, the solitary fun of the gamebooks was
not as appealing as the social fun of tabletop RPGs, and what little
desire I had for something like gamebooks was was more than adequately
served by |T&T| solo adventures.  In any case, I never owned any |FF|
gamebooks until I picked up the 2003 iBooks reprints of `The Warlock
of Firetop Mountain` and `The Citadel of Chaos`.

This also means that I missed out on the |FF| and |AFF| RPGs, as
well.  Thank Hamaskis_ for Internet bookstores!

…but Internet RPG Forums are amazing
====================================

I had run across a mention of a `Fighting Fantasy` RPG, somewhere
(probably on `rpg.net`_), and eventually figured out it was `Fighting
Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game` (|FF:TIRpG|) and
purchased a copy from a used bookstore online.  It was easy to find,
as I recall. [#many]_

Mechanically it is the system from the |FF| gamebooks, but with
explanations for new tabletop gamers of how to use it for tabletop
gaming.  It is actually a nice introductory RPG, but it was a little
too simple for the game I wanted, and my interested stopped there for
a while.

(I only got `The Riddling Reaver`, a collection of adventures for
|FF:TIRpG|, in 2011, after I got |AFF2e| and |AFF|.)

At some point I figured out (again, probably by reading on `rpg.net`_)
that the `Advanced Fighting Fantasy` RPG was a different set of books
from the |FF| RPG, with a more detailed system, and it was probably
what I should have been looking for instead of |FF:TIRpG|, but my
interest had fall asleep; no doubt in part because the third book of the
set, `Allansia`, was reputedly difficult and expensive to get. [#few]_

However, the `Arion Games`_ edition (|AFF2e|) published in 2011
reawakened my interest.  I got that edition, and liked the system and
setting, but wondered how different it was to the original |AFF|.
Eventually I decided I wanted to compare |AFF2e| to the original
|AFF|, so it was back to the Internet bookstores.  `Dungeoneer` and
`Blacksand!` were relatively easy to find (`Dungeoneer` in
particular), but an relatively affordable copy of `Allansia` was more
difficult.  Eventually I was successful. Yesterday `Allansia` arrived,
and today `Blacksand!` arrived.

At My Table
===========

I'm planning to use |AFF| as my pickup game with the kids_, the game
we play when something else has to be canceled, too few players are
available, or I'm just too tired to play anything more complicated.
I'm looking to make use of the `Titan` setting, with all its
over-the-top fantasy elements.

I'm going to start with the original |FF| RPG, play that for a few
sessions, add in the stuff from `Dungeoneer`, then `Blacksand!`, then
`Allansia`, maybe all in the same episodic campaign.  Eventually I'll
transition to another campaign, using the |AFF| 2e rules.  At the end
of it all I should be able to do a good comparison of all three rules
sets.  Maybe then I'll do an actual review, but don't hold your
breath.

===============================================================

Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game (FF:TIRpG)
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. _`FF:TIRpG`:

The system in `Fighting Fantasy - The Introductory Role-playing Game`
is pretty much the same as in the `Fighting Fantasy`:series: game
books.

The game calls the person who ‘controls’ the game the GameMaster or
GM (p. 11).  The player characters are called “adventureres” (p. 9, 10).

* `Fighting Fantasy`__ — `The Introductory Role-playing Game`:subtitle:
  (copyright 1984 by Steve Jackson; ISBN 0-14-031709-0), and

* `The Riddling Reaver`__ (copyright 1986 by Steve Jackson, Paul
  Mason, and Steve Williams; ISBN 0-14-032156-X), a collection of
  four adventures for |FF:TIRpG|.

__ http://fightingfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy_-_The_Introductory_Role-Playing_Game
__ http://fightingfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/The_Riddling_Reaver_(book)

These are standard mass-market paperbacks, 11×17.6 cm, 4¼×6⅞ in.  

There were also the `Fighting Fantasy Manuals`__, a couple of books
detailing the monsters and world of the |FF| gamebooks: `Out of the
Pit` and `Titan`.  These are large format paperbacks, A4 sized (around
US Letter sized).

* `Out of the Pit`_, `Fighting Fantasy Monsters`:subtitle: (copyright

  ISBN ISBN 0-14-031999-9), and

* `Titan`_, `The Fighting Fantasy World`:subtitle: (copyright 1986 by Marc
  Gascoigne, Steve Jackson, and Ian Livingstone; ISBN 0-14-032127-6)
  detailing the Fighting Fantasy world).

Advanced Fighting Fantasy (AFF)
-------------------------------

.. _`AFF`:

`Advanced Fighting Fantasy`__ took the role-playing system from the
gamebooks and |FF:TIRpG| and developed them in more detail, adding
‘Special Skills', which allow characters to more skilled in specific
areas than just their general SKILL, a magic system, a couple of mass
battle systems, etc.

The game uses the metaphor of making a fantasy movie, so the person
running the game is called the *Director* (p. 11) and the player
characters are called *Heroes* (p. 9).

These were published as paperbacks approximately 13×20 cm, about
5×7¾ in.  There were matching releases of `Out of the Pit` and `Titan`
to go along with the new game, in the same size.

* `Out of the Pit`_, `Fighting Fantasy Monsters`:subtitle: (copyright

Advanced Fighting Fantasy, 2\ :sup:`nd` edition (AFF2e)
-------------------------------------------------------

.. _`AFF2e`:

In 2011 `Arion Games`_ published a 2\ :sup:`nd` edition, distributed
by `Cubicle 7`_:

* `Advanced Fighting Fantasy`, `The Roleplaying Game`:subtitle:,
  2\ :sup:`nd` edition (copyright 2011 by Graham Bottley, Steve
  Jackson, and Ian Livingston; ISBN 978-0-85744-067-9),
* `Out of the Pit` (copyright 1985; `Arion Games`_ edition 2011,
  ISBN 978-0-85744-068-6), and
* `Titan`, (copyright 1986; `Arion Games`_ edition 2011,
  ISBN 978-9-85744-069-3). 

These paperbacks are approximately 21.5×28 cm, pretty much exactly
8.5×11 in.  These editions of `Out of the Pit` and `Titan` are
essentially straight reprints.

Unfortunately, the license `Arion Games`_ has to publish |AFF2e|
precludes PDF versions of the books.

.. [#many] I don't know if |FF:TIRpG| was easy to find because they
   printed so many of it, or if it was just part of the large print
   runs they used to use in general.

.. [#few] I suspect that `Allansia` was published late enough that
   print runs in general had shrunk in size considerably, even if the
   print run for `Allansia` in particular was small simply because it
   was the third book in the |AFF| RPG series, which was bound to make
   it less  popular than the gamebooks in any case.
