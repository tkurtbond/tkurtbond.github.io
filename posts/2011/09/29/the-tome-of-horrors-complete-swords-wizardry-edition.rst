My copy of `Frog God Games`__ `The Tome of Horrors Complete`__, for
`Swords & Wizardry`__, arrived today.  My, that's a massive tome: a
hardback with 671 numbered pages followed by 14 pages of
advertisements.  (In a smaller book, I might have complained about
that many pages of advertisements, but in a book this large it doesn't
seem excessive.)  From my earlier quick perusal of the PDF and a brief
scan of the hardback today I'm very pleased with the content, and I'm
looking forward to using this in my game.  To the folks who worked on
this: well done!
