The items you can find on this blog under the `category Actual-Play`_
and `tag actual-play`_ (except for this entry) describe actual play
sessions from some of my games.  They tend more to describing in-game
events, but sometimes talk about mechanical aspects of the game
illuminated during the session, or creative aspects of running a game.
Sometimes they're just a session recap, written so that when I come
back to that campaign in a week or a month or six months so I can look
up the details of the last couple of sessions to figure out what was
happening and where the campaign is going.  These latter sometimes
are barely more than a list of the places the PCs visited and events
of notoriety:

    The PCs went to `20`:area:, where Olsman chopped the
    head off an ogre with one blow.  Afterwards they started down the
    stairs to `23`:area:, but the stairs collapsed into a slide, and much
    hilarity ensued as they tried to avoid stabbing and bashing each other
    as they tumbled down and landed in a deep pool.
