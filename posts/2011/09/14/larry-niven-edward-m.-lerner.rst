  .. admonition:: Spoilers!

     The following discussion includes spoilers for this book.

  I like learning more of Louis Wu's background, but I thought pulling
  him into the Puppeteer fleet, giving him a child, and kicking him
  out with his memories removed, all before the events of Ringworld,
  damaged my suspension of disbelief.

  I thought the writing of this book was perfectly adequate, if not to
  the standards of Niven in his prime.
