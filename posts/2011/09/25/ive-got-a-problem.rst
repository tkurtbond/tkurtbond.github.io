I've got a problem â€” I like RPGs just as an area of study and as
artifacts, even if I never get to play a particular RPG.  When I was
younger I'd buy new systems just to compare them, even if I never
expected to play them.  Even now I sometimes buy multiple editions of
a game to compare them, often delving back to through the earlier
editions of game to see how things have changed and what's been lost
along the way, [#osr-analysis]_ although usually only if I'm actually
planning on playing one or more editions of the game.

As a consequence of this, I've got more RPGs than I'll ever get a
chance to play, and I'm still interested in buying new ones.

I have resolved to play more of the games that I already have, though,
and I've got specific plans for several of them.

.. [#osr-analysis] I've found the work that folks in the OSR_ [#osr-defn]_
   are doing analyzing the various versions of `D&D` and other
   old-school games very interesting.  I'd love to see even more games
   given this treatement: the various versions of `RuneQuest` and
   `BRP`, the Palladium RPGs, the various varieties of `Rolemaster`
   and its children, and so forth.  A pity that my obsessions have yet
   to drag my unorganized ruminations over the mountains of clarity
   and illumination and into the blogosphere.

.. [#osr-defn]  Does anyone have a link to a good explanation of the OSR?
