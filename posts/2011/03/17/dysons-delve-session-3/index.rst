Play
====

Stairwell smelled of oil (Elric & Zoric made their saves).  Elric
threw his torch down the stairs, got a 20, and the torch bounced down
around the stairs setting the oil and timber the goblins had filled
the stairs with on fire.  The heat and fire collapsed the hole leading
down to the stairs.  After searching around some more, Emma Lee found
a trail leading to the cave entrance that lead to room #1.  Gloriana
killed the giant ferret. They make a plan to deal with the rat nest
they know is in room #2: Emma Lee and Gloriana will stand at the east
side of room #1 with bows ready while Elric and
Zoric go into room #2 to throw oil at the rats and light it.  Zoric's
oil flask bounces off the back of an attacking rat & did not break.
Rats wounded Zoric and he fell unconscious, and 5 of his 7 remaining
oil flasks broke between his plate armor and the stone floor.  Elric
grabbed Zoric and started dragging him back and threw the torch, their
only light, onto the pool of oil, setting it ablaze, and thereby
catching the 3 rats attacking them on fire.  This maddened the rates
and they charged after Elric and brought him down.  Emma Lee and
Gloriana loose arrows, but Emma Lee's bowstring breaks.  Gloriana
kills the last rat by the dim light of the burning oil pool around the
corner and the weakened sunlight filtering through the dense thicket
and down the entrance tunnel.  Zoric and Elric are both unconscious
but alive.  Back to town for four more days of recuperation.
