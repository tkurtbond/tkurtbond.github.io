Play
====

To room #1, kill 7 rats, look around, to room #2, 7 goblins wander in,
Zoric to #1 and falls on his back, breaking 5 of the 10 oil flasks in
his backpack.  Elric cuts him out of his backpack, pulls him back, and
sets the oil ablaze with his torch.  Goblins have to fight around
flame, only 2 at a time, and are defeated eventually, leaving the
party to struggle back to town for four more days of rest.  They head
back to the dungeon, to room #7 via room #1.  On to room #8, room #11,
room #9, room #10a, room #11.  Emma Lee and Elric are down and
unconscious, but Zoric turns the skeletons.  Back to town.  They rest
three days and go shopping on the next day.  The chain mail they found
is a relic of the Old Kingdom.
