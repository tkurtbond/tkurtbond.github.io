L.B. was in for spring break, so I decided to run `Dyson's Delve`_
using `Swords & Wizardry Whitebox` (the `Brave Halfling`__ version,
which I have in hardback and box).  Unfortunately, L.B.'s cousins
*weren't* on spring break, so we be played in the evenings after they
got their homework done, and since they had to get up early in time
for school the next day we played fairly short sessions.

.. admonition:: Spoilers!

   We're playing `Dyson's Delve`_, so if you haven't played that you
   might want to skip this entry.

Attending
=========

Clockwise, starting with the Dungeon Master 

* T.K.B. — Dungeon Master
* E.A. — Emma Lee, a gluttonous guard (fighter) who grew up as a woodsman
* L.B. — Gloriana, a vain knight errant (fighter) who grew up as a woodsman
* M.A. — Zoric, a superstitious oracle (cleric) who grew up as a woodsman
* T.A. — Elric, an superstitious student of ancient lore (elf) who grew up as
  a street urchin

Character Generation
====================

I decided we'd use `Alex Schroeder`__\ 's `Character Generation
Shortcuts`__ (which covered Fighters, Clerics, and Wizards) and `More
Character Generation Shortcuts`__ (which covered Elves, Dwarves, and
Halfings) charts to create characters.  This sped up character
generation, but it also gave the characters customized classes,
past experience, character qualities, and background qualities and
events from the characters' early years and recent past, and their
standard equipment.  For example, one of the PCs was Elf, a
**superstitious** **student of ancient lore** who was originally a **street
urchin** and who had recently committed a **shameful deed** and had to
flee town.

He had a PDF of the former, and I made a quick
PDF of the later so I could have a printout for the character
generation session.

(Alex later posted a revised PDF_ with more demihuman backgrounds and a
starting spell for the wizard and elf backgrounds.)

I think the subclass approach he used is a great idea - it adds a lot
of flavor, without needing any additional rules.

I also decided to use the background as a skill substitute.  If the
character needed to do something that was covered by their background
(for example, a woodsman could track) they could either just do it, or
if it was difficult they could make a saving throw, possibly with a
bonus.

Anyway, we rolled up characters using Alex's tables and 3d6 for
attributes, arranged to taste. I let them have max hitpoints for 1st
level, and I decided that cleric spells would start at first level (in
`S&W Whitebox`, like `Original D&D` and `Basic D&D`, clerics get their
first spell at 2nd level) because the kids tend to rush into things
with out thinking them out, so they'd need :spell:`cure light
wounds`.  I also let them buy some extra equipment beyond what was in
Alex's tables.  

The kids all really enjoyed the customized classes and the background
elements from Alex's tables.

Play
====

I decided that a merchant wagon train had been attacked by goblins and
the merchant had been kidnapped.  One of the ox drivers had survived
and stumbled into the a nearby town with the stories.  The PCs decided
to try and rescue him in hopes of a reward.  They found the trail of
the goblins, and it lead them to a hill topped with ruins.  In the
ruins they found a hole under a leaning, partially collapsed wall that
lead to the steps that lead down to room #4 of `Dyson's Delve`.

They killed one of the goblins guarding the entrance stairs, but the
other goblin got away, alerting the goblins in room #5.  The PCs
paused briefly to loot the dead goblin, but then ran after the other
goblin, into room #5, where they were ambushed by the alerted goblins.
Battle raged around the room, and when the boss from room #6 joined in
things looked bleak for a while, but they killed off the goblins with
only Gloriana still standing.  Gloriana dragged everybody to room #6
and locked the door, and there they stayed for a couple of days until
people were healed up a bit.  They then went to explore more, even
though several of them were hurt quite badly.  They went back to room
#4, and spent some time arguing, until they were attacked by giant
rats.  After that they spent more time in room #6.
