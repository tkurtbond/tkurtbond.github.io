Play
====

Started in room #6.  To room #7, to room #1, to room #2.  Rats attack
Elric & Gloriana, a few rounds later the ferrets from #3 join in,
attacking Zoric & Emma Lee, who end up unconscious.  Gloriana throws
bacon over ferrets, who run after it and eat.  Elric and Gloriana pick
up their friends and flee back north, but ferrets run around and trap
them in the narrow corridors.  Gloriana killed one behind, which
blocked tunnel, while Elric fell against the other.  Gloriana
sacrificed her shield and helmet to turn 2 death blows and finally
killed the 2nd ferret.  Gloriana again was the only PC left standing,
and she dragged the other PCs back to room #6.  While pulling the last
PC back to room #6 she ran into a wandering monster, a hobgoblin,
which she killed.  They stayed in the locked room, slowly healing up,
and left the dungeon on the evening of day 4, and arrived back in town
before dawn on day 5.  They healed up and went shopping.  

Total loot: 131 gp 1 ep each.

Elric left Zoric's lantern burning in the rat's passage, but Gloriana
bought a new one for Zoric.
