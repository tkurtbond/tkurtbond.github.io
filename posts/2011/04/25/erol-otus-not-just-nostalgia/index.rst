When I started playing D&D back in my mid teens and the early 1980s I
did not particularly like the artwork of Erol Otus.  I think at the
time I preferred more realistic artwork.

When I got back into playing D&D regularly with 3.5E, I also started
looking back at the older versions of D&D, and found that I now really
liked Erol Otus's artwork.  I think it is the fever dream aspect of it
that I like.  

So, my enjoyment of Otus's work has nothing to do with nostalgia.
