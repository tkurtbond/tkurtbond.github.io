Wal-Mart carries the ifrogz_ Plugz_ earbuds for 10$, and for cheap ear
buds I like these the best of the ones I've tried.  They are
comfortable, they stay in my ears, the soft plastic tips don't come
off (unlike the memory foam tips on many cheap ear buds, which I was
always loosing), and they do a reasonable job of cutting down outside
noise.
