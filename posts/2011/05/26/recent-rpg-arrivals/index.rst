I got an order from IPR_ today, with `Houses of the Blooded`, `The
Dresden Files - Your Story`, `The Dresden Files - Our World`, and a
gift copy of `Hero System Sidekick` [#Sidekick]_.

`Your Story` and `Our World` look very impressive after a first quick
scan.  I like all the annotations and marginal notes, although I'd
have preferred that the post-it notes had been marginal notes as well.

.. [#Sidekick] That makes my second gift copy of `Sidekick`, and three copies
   in total.  I'm sure that means I'm destined to run a `Sidekick`
   campaign for the kids, when they're all old enough for Hero 5ER
   [#5ER]_ math.  And I am [#5ERmath]_. :-)

.. [#5ER] That's `Hero System`, Fifth Edition, Revised.

.. [#5ERmath] Actually, the kids are probably readier for that than I
   am.  I'm liking less and less math at the game table as I grow
   older and have less time to prepare and play.
