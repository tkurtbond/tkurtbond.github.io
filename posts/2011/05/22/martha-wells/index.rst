* `The Cloud Roads`, by Martha Wells, copyright 2011;
  ISBN 978-1-59780-216-1.

  The start of a new series; the main character is `Moon`:character:.

  I liked it, although not as much as the `Valiarde`:character:
  books.  (One of the reasons I liked those books is their
  Victorian and Edwardian technologically-equivalent setting, which
  despite the airships didn't seem to be as genre-indulgent as much
  steampunk does.)
