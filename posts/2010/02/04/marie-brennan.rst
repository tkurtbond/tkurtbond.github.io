* `Midnight Never Come`, by Marie Brennan, copyright 2008 by Bryn
  Neuenscwander; ISBN-13 978-0-316-02029-9.

  I really enjoyed this mix of faerie an Elizabethan England.
  Interestingly, this novel was inspired by part of a campaign of the
  `Changeling` RPG, which was one of the things talked about in the
  informative “Extras” section of the book, where she recommends three
  books by the folklorist Katherine Briggs: two on general British
  faerie lore (`British Folk-Tales and Legends` and `The Faeries in
  Tradition and Literature`) and one specifically about Shakespeare's
  time (`The Anatomy of Puck`).  I'll have to look for those, and for
  Maire Brennan's other books.  She has a `website
