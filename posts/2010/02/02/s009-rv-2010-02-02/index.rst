Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the DM at 6 o'clock:

+ P.D.F. as DM
+ T.K.B. playing Droston a'Seamus
+ B.MC. playing Polonius, Onchu's rowdy young cousin from Riverton
+ M.A.F. playing Bartha
+ C.A.H. playing Onchu

C.A.H. is very late: **–500 XP**.

Introduction
============

Bartha was gravely wounded (3 WP) in the last episode. 

We start in the entrance room with Droston and Bartha on the exit side
of the chasm and Onchu and Polonius on the other side of the chasm,
next to the barred door into the rest of the cavern complex.

Actual Play
===========

Ropes and Chasms
----------------

Droston and Bartha eventually join the others across the chasm, after
entirely too much fiddling around with rope.

Polonius picks up a light crossbow and 12 bolts from a defeated
hobgoblin. 

Onchu and Droston press against the door while Polonius tries to raise
the bar with a knife.  Eventually they succeed.

A Storeroom?
------------

The next room proved to be a store room with two large piles of goods
and hobgoblin sleeping gear, with a cell to the south, a
kitchen (with a chimney) off a tunnel to the south-east, a large room
off a tunnel to the north, and a tunnel to the north-east that curved
and then forked northeast again, which lead to another large room,
which later turned out to be the same as the large room off the north
tunnel.

Straight from the Centaur's…
----------------------------

Bartha snuck around the the side of the southern pile of goods,
towards the cell, with Droston following with a drawn bow.  The cell
to the south turned out to contain a centaur!  Bartha, knowing
centaurs were Fey creatures thanks to her evening of revelry with the
Fey of the Lady of the Valley, rushed to free him, and tried to
converse; unfortunately, about all we could figure out was that he
recognized Whaler's fey name.  He had us all turn around and look
elsewhere while he grunted a few times, then presented Bartha with a
vial of thick colored liquid.  She drank, and was immediately healed.
She escorted the centaur back to the chasm room where it leaped the
chasm handily, and ran away.  We, stupidly, didn't follow him.

We were Warned…
---------------

We were attacked by two hobgoblins from the north passage, and killed
them easily.

We investigated the south-east passage, which lead to an unoccupied
kitchen. 

We investigated the north-east passage, taking the north fork, which
lead to a large room with a fire and some hobgoblins. 

…But We Didn't Go 
-----------------

We investigated the north passage, which lead to a large room.  

We were immediately attacked by 3 hobgoblins.  Droston and Bartha
stayed in the tunnel and loosed arrows at them, while Onchu and
Polonius ran out and engaged them in melee.  

Then three more hobgoblins showed up.  Bartha ran to the help of Onchu
and Polonius.

Then an ogre and two wolves showed up.  A wolf tripped Onchu, and
joined with the other wolf to tear him to shreds.  Polonius, separated
from the others, fled south-east down the large room.  Bartha fled the
room, taking with her the only light source, condemning Onchu and
Polonius to the darkness, and fled to the other end of the tunnel.
The ogre entered the tunnel and whacked Droston who screamed and
yelled for Bartha to flee and fled himself.  (Luckily he was wearing
his night vision goggles and could see to flee!)

And Then We Died, or Fled
-------------------------

Onchu, meanwhile, died, and the wolves chased Polonius into the dark
of the other end of the room, and the hobgoblins followed.  Bartha and
Droston made it back to the room with the chasm, and hearing
Polonius's death cries, Droston barred the door through the handles
with a hobgoblin longsword abandoned nearby.

Meanwhile, Bartha had tied the ropes across the chasm, and she and
Droston fled into the open air beyond the caverns, where they
eventually caught up with the centaur, and they all hid, mourning
their fallen comrades.


Aftermath
=========

After the adventure, Bartha and Droston were both **6200 XP**
characters, and C.A.H. and B.MC. were working on new characters.
