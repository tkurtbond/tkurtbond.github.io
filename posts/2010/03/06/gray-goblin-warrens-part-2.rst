   We're playing Christopher Brackett's One Page Dungeon `The Gray
   Goblin Warrens`, from the blog `A Rust Monster Ate My Sword`_,
   which can be found as part of `The One Page Dungeon Codex 2009`_.
   If you haven't played that you might want to skip this entry.

Attending
=========

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord
+ M.A., playing Niall, a cleric
+ L.B., playing Caramel, a halfling
+ T.A., playing Angrim, and Elf

Actual Play
===========

S, W to SW, S, SE, S, SE, NE, NW, around CH, N, NW, SW, slid down the greased
steps and all fell in northmost **O** (Oubliette).  I said that
Caramel's 10 foot pole fell across the entrance to the oubliette, so
they were able to throw Angrim's grappling hook up and snag it and
climb back out.

Back up the greased steps, and then NE to northmost **G**, where they
killed 4 gray goblins.  9 sp, 14 sp, 3 sp, 11 sp, 4 scale armor, 2
light crossbows, 4 flails.  Caramel took one light crossbow.  

Went back to village.  With last time's haul they have 8 scale armor
(260 gp), 4 maces (10 gp), 4 flails (6 gp), 3 light crossbows (24
gp).  Total: 300 gp, 100 gp each.  Spent 2 weeks at village.

Back to the Gray Goblin Warrens.  S, W to SW, S, SE, S, SW, first
covered pit.  Angrim fell in.  Used Caramel's 12 iron spikes to get
around turn to where Angrim could climb up.  

Back to village.
