   We're playing `Evernight`, the Savage Worlds campaing, so if you
   haven't played that you might want to skip this entry.

Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Games Master:

+ T.K.B., the Games Master.
+ M.A., playing Jostein, a Human Red Knight.
+ T.A., playing Corazon, an Elven Battle Mage; and Dag (who was
  almost D.B.'s character), a Human Sun Priest.
+ E.A., playing Danyell, an Elven theif.
+ No L.B., alas.

Actual Play
===========

Played `Act I`:area: through to the beginning of `Scene Six`:area:,
“The Savage Caves”.

Reflections
===========

This was a better than average game.  We were able to play an
unusually long session, even though we had to stop for pizza for
dinner in the middle, watching ½ hour of `The Mummy` while we ate.
