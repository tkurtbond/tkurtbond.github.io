</ul></section><section id="actual-play"><h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p><strong>1st day:</strong> They all hunted, since Mad Sammy's stores were running
low.  They found 20 days worth of food, which they shared with Mad
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>2nd day:</strong> They went back to the crypt, to the room with the orange
and green painted keyholes.  The two shadows attacked them, but
luckily for the PCs, by this point in the adventure many had magic
weapons, and they were able to land some good solid hits.  The shadows
faded into the gloom, and then attacked again when the PCs attention
was diverted.  This time the party handily disposed of the shadows.</p>
<p>They then used the Green &amp; Orange Rod Keys, and the secret door
opened.  The climbed down the chain (a couple slipped, but caught
themselves) to the lower level and opened the double doors into what
turned out to be the final room of the crypt.  It contained two stone
coffins with statues atop each.  They were talking about pulling down
the statutes so they could open the coffins when the statue on the
left coffin attacked — it was actually a gargoyle.  They killed it
without much trouble, and turned to the statue on the right.  That
statue was firmly fixed to the coffin and they were unable to pull it
down.  They turned back to the other coffin, which opened easily.
They pulled out the treasure and read the note wrapped around the
ring, and heard the banging and screeching start in the right-side
coffin, while simultaneously the statue from that coffin fell and
struck two of the party glancing blows.</p>
<p>Despite the noises from the coffin, they opened it with the key
none-the-less — the lid was pushed back, and a medusa sat up,
surprising them all.  All but one of the PCs were turned to stone by
the baleful gaze of the medusa.  Grimmin was the lucky adventurer, and
he resisted the gaze once again, while he ran around behind the other
coffin, where he quickly rifled through his backpack and found the
silver mirror.  Standing up with the mirror before him, he avoided the
medusa's gaze, while she looked full into the mirror and was turned to
stone.</p>
<p>Grimmin was left alone, surrounded by the petrified bodies of his
friends.  The <em class="scroll">Stone to Flesh</em> scrolls they had found earlier
were also, unfortunately petrified, as was all the treasure they had
accumulated before this room.  Fortunately, there was plenty of
treasure in this room.  After spending a night with Mad Sam, Grimmin
set off for civilization to find more scrolls of <em class="scroll">Stone to
Flesh</em> and a novice wizard to accompany him back and read the scrolls
to free his comrades.  Eventually he did, but it cost him all the loot
from the last room.  He traveled back to the crypt with Harlan, his
hired magic user, but as they came down the steps they were attacked
by skeletons.  Grimmin, knowing that if Harlan was killed it was all
up for his companions, bravely threw himself in the path of the blow
intended for Harlan, and was stuck by the other skeleton as well, and
luckily survived both.  After that, with help from Harlan's Magic
Missile, it was easy to finish off the skeletons.</p>
<p>Once they got to the statues, the magic user read the scrolls and the
PCs were restored.  After a night's rest in Mad Sammy's basement they
all (except for Sammy) set off for civilization.  However, on the
first night out, on the sleeping Grimmin's watch, they were attacked
by wolves.  Once awake they fought back valiantly.  When the Guardian
of the Crypt, a great glowing orb with one eye, appeared they were at
first taken aback, and feared the Guardian had killed Harlan when it
sent a bolt of magical energy into the tree where Harlan had hidden.
However, Arlow ended up killing it with one <em class="spell">Magic Missile</em>,
and they finished off the wolves without too much difficulty  They
returned to tell Sammy that his nightmare was over, and then all
(including Sammy, this time) left for civilization.</p>
</section><section id="loot-xp"><h2>Loot &amp; XP</h2>
<p>The loot for the final room was 5930 gp, all used to buy scrolls and
hire Harlan to read them.  The previous loot was 3108 gp, so everybody
got 388.5 gp.  Total monster XP for the whole adventure was <strong>797 XP</strong>
divided by eight PCs and rounded to <strong>100 XP</strong>.  Total XP with the
loot (once they got it back to civilization), per PC, was <strong>1230 XP</strong>
each.  Not even James the Thief leveled!</p>
<p>So ended the <strong>Fabled Curse of the Brigand Crypt</strong>!</p>
</section><section id="afterward"><h2>Afterward</h2>
<p>I pointed out to the kids that very little of their final XPs came
from killing monsters, that most of it came from taking their
stuff, and that if they could do the later without the former they'd
be better off.</p>
<p>We talked about what game to play next, during the school year when
L.B. isn't here, and they eventually decided on <cite>Evernight</cite>, the
<cite>Savage Worlds</cite> campaign, at T.A.'s suggestion.  That was fine with
me!</p>
<p>Next week, when L.A. <em>is</em> in, we'll work on <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em>.
We are getting near the end, and L.A. has said that she doesn't want
it to end.  I'll have to see what I can do about that.  Perhaps I'll
populate one of the dungeon maps I've drawn recently, and make it the
<em>Cave of the Unknown</em>…</p>
