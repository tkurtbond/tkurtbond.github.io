+ `We Few`, copyright 2005 by David Web and John Ringo; A Baen
  Book/Baen PUblishing Enterprises, second Baen Books paperback
  printing, January 2009.

  I don't know whether I read this when it was first published in
  2005â€“2006. In any case, it's a fun read, if you like military
  science fiction.
