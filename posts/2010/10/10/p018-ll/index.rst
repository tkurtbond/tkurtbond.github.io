Actual Play
===========

Went back through `J`:area: to `50`:area:, where they had discovered
the secret door.  They went through and discovered skeleton.  Jeffry
has the boots.  Spent a bunch of time arguing, which lead to a
wandering monster encounter: 4 goblins easily killed, with no loot.
Went through second secret door, explored `63`:area:, nothing
valuable.  Headed north & Dooley ran into a gelatinous cube.  Others
pulled him back and fled.  Argued about how to kill the gelatinous
cube, which lead to another wandering monster encounter: 22 goblins,
the rest of the tribe, looking for their lost 4 scouts.  This left
half of the party unconscious, but thanks to the staff of healing,
wand of paralyzation, & `sleep`:spell: they survived.  They had used
up their healing for the day, so went back to the keep for 1 week,
then on to `62`:area:, where they opened coffins until they found a
wight.  It rolled a `3`:dice: for its attack on its surprise round,
then lost initiative to the party, whereupon James rolled well and
turned it.  It fled.  They found a hidden compartment with a helmet,
which Dooley promptly put on.  Alas for everybody, it was a `helm of
evil`:item:.  Intra-party conflict ensued, until Dooley was rendered
unconscious by Curufin's sleep.  At the end, the `scroll`:item: went
to Alice, the `+1 flaming sword`:item: to Jeffry, the `elven
boots`:item: to Dooley.  Gelatinous cube loot: 4 cp, 5 sp, 5 ep, 3 gp,
2 pp, `wand of fireballs`:item:.

Reflections
===========

I was really off at this session, even though I had been looking
forward to it.  The kids were unfocused and I was unable to get them
to concentrate.  Eventually I gave up.  The kids played some of Lily's
new games (Doodle Dice) until Charlita called for her kids to come
home.
