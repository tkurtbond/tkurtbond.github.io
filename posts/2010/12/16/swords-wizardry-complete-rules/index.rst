I bought a copy of the PDF and paperback [#paperback]_ of `Swords &
Wizardry: Complete Rules`__ [#rulesbook-vs-rules]_ from `Frog God
Games`__ this evening, and after a quick scan of the PDF my initial
reaction is positive: it does look like what I'd hoped it would be: a
much better organized restatement of the seven original `D&D`
booklets, and I think it is likely to become one of my favorite
versions of `D&D`.  Matthew Finch of `Mythemere Games`__ and Frog God
Games have done what looks like a fine job.

`Swords & Wizardry: Complete Rules` is a `retro-clone`_ of original
`D&D`.

I'm going to have to sit down and read this in detail very soon.

.. [#paperback] I'd have liked to have gotten one of the hardback
   copies, but those sold out long before I'd realized they'd been
   published.

.. [#rulesbook-vs-rules] The cover says `Swords & Wizardry Complete
   Rulebook`, while the title page says `Swords & Wizardry Core Rules`.
