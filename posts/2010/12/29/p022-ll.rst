Actual Play
===========

Remember the heroic fight of the doomed Green Dot Army, who helped
make the world safe from Chaos!

I used green glass tokens to represent the party's hirelings, and the
final climactic battle in the Caves of Chaos included a private army
of hirelings, 50 or so strong.  They were a heroic sight setting out
from the Keep for the Caves.

Via `K`:area: to `62`:area:.  Dooley pried out geoms.  James and Alice
each turned some skeletons.  Acolytes from `56`:area: ran to
`58`:area: and rang the bell, 20 zombies and 20 skeletons came out.

The party and their 50 hirelings fought the zombies and skeletons.  It
was a grim and uncertain battle, but Law triumphed over Chaos in the end.

All but four of the hirelings died in the battle, and only two of
those four made it back to the Keep.  The party paid for nice
funerals, so people (probably) don't spit at them as they walk through
the Keep.
