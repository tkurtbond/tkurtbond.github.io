More gaming with the kids_.  D.B. left the farm after lunch, before we
had a chance to play, but E.A. and M.A. were available and eager to
play.  They created some new characters to add to the party —
E.A. created Leanna (a Dwarf) and M.A. created Zedd (a Magic User).

.. admonition:: Spoilers!

   We're playing `Prime Requisite Games`_ `DLD2 — Fabled Curse of the
   Brigand Crypt`_, so if you haven't played that you might want to
   skip this entry.

Actual Play
===========

The characters from `part 1`_ spent several days healing and resting.
Some friends who'd had the same idea about finding the brigands'
treasure showed up (M.A.'s Zedd and E.A's Leanna) and were welcomed to
the party.  Zedd brought his pony, who sleeps with them in Mad Sammy's
cellar at night.

.. note:: For some reason I think the first fight in the sarcophagus
   happened right after the fight with the ghouls, but my notes say
   it happened in the second session.  I'll put it both places for
   now. 

They went back to room **6**, and decided to open one of the closed
stone coffins, and while pushing the heavy lid off, Elsie, along with
several others, fell into the coffin on top of the skeleton.  The
others managed to (eventually) exit the coffin, but poor Elsie was too
entangled with the skeleton.  Eventually the party killed the
skeleton, but Elsie ended in the negative hit points, so
they went back to Mad Sammy's with Elsie on a floating disk to
recover.

After healing up, they went back to room **6** and opened coffin #2,
where a couple fell in again, but got pulled out more quickly.  They
killed the skeleton and opened the rest of the coffins and found the
treasure and a key.  They move through room **7**, empty since its
occupants were killed in room **6** in the first session, and enter
room **8**, where the piercers drop, impaling Zedd & Leanna & missing
Arlow.  They eventually pull the piercers out (doing more damage in
the process, and kill the piercers.  Then it was back to Mad Sammy's
to rest again.  

When they returned to the crypt they entered room **9** where they
pulled down the hanging bodies and were attacked by the 2 blue cave
spiders.  John is bit and paralyzed, but the others kill the spiders.
John recovers from the paralysis in 6 rounds, and makes his save
vs. poison, so lives.  (Maybe here is when they went back to Sam's,
instead, or also?)  Next they're down the stairs to room **10**.  John
puts the key in first, gets bit, and tries to bash the statue with his
flail, and gets bit again.  Finally he drops the key, which rolls to
the floor after the statue releases John's arm.  Next they put the
stones in: Elsie the green (one of her weapons glows), Arlow the gray
(and he gets gray hair), James the gold (he gets a ring from the
statute, which Zedd puts on then returns to James, who puts it in the
statue's mouth, whereupon it falls out again), Grimmin the red (stung
for 1 HP of damage), Hermes the blue (he made his save), and then
Elsie put the key in.  They heard the chain beyond the wall, and got
the Green Rod Key, and then were attacked by the shadow.  By the time
they got it off Elsie, she was in the negatives, and by the time they
got it off Leanna (injuring her with their non-magical weapons in the
process and figuring out they could only injure the shadow the magic)
she was in the negatives took, so they grabbed the girls and fled,
leaving the shadow.  Each time the shadow attacked from the shadows
and the party was surprised.  Of course, they ran back to Mad Sam's,
although they did close the crypt doors on the way out.
