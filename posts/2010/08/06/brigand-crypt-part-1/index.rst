I had originally planned to start off the school year campaign for the
A. kids_ with *B5 — Horror on the Hill*, by Douglas Niles, but since
D.B. was in and M.A. and E.A. were not available, I started instead
with `Prime Requisite Games`_ `DLD2 — Fabled Curse of the Brigand Crypt`_, by
R. Lawrence Blake.

.. admonition:: Spoilers!

   We're playing `Prime Requisite Games`_ `DLD2 — Fabled Curse of the
   Brigand Crypt`_, so if you haven't played that you might want to
   skip this entry.

T.A., E.A., and M.A. had created characters earlier, but D.B. had to
create characters before we started.

Attending
=========

+ T.K.B. — Labyrinth Lord
+ D.B. played *James* (a Thief) and *Hermes* (a Magic User), and also
  played *John* (a Cleric) who was created by M.A.
+ T.A played *Arlow* (an Elf) and *Grimmin* (a Dwarf), and also played
  Elsie (an Elf), who was created by E.A.

Actual Play
===========

They reached the village of Iron City, where the bandits were supposed
to have lived, in the late afternoon.  They searched several of the
houses, until they reached the storehouse.  They broke in the door
(the tongue of the lock tore out of the jamb) and questioned poor mad
Sammy, who was frightened by them but called down enough to talk once
they showed him no harm.  He babbled about everything but several
times repeated to them that they should *not* let “the eye” see them,
and that it roamed at night.  They decided to spend the night with
him, and barred the door, as best they could.

The next day they searched the rest of the town, found the well, and
entered the temple.  They pulled out the stones and the key, and
luckily pulled the key out last, so no one got bit.  James pulled out
the *red* stone, but gave it to Grimmin.  Elsie pulled out the *green*
stone.  Arlow pulled out the *gray* stone.  James pulled out the
*gold* stone.  Hermes pulled out the *blue* stone.  John pulled out
the *key*.  After that they opened the Crypt with the key and explored
room **1**, and over the course of several days opened all the burial
vaults in that room, killed the undead, and found the treasure and the
keys.  They had to rest and heal at least twice and each time took at
least two days.

After clearing out the burial vaults in room **1**, they went down the
stairs to room **2**, where T.A. insisted on searching for secret
doors, repeatedly, using up almost five hours of daylight.  Eventually
they opened the door with the key from burial vault **E**.  Entering,
they heard the sound from the east end of the corridor, investigated,
and found the pit, **4**.  Seeing the green-daubed hole, they decided
to investigate and James slid down a rope held by Elsie and Hermes.
The 2 skeletons immediately attacked, and Grimmin slid down to help,
but fell.  John slid down too.  Grimmin blunted his battle ax on the
stone wall and dropped it, while John dropped his flail after also
hitting the wall.  After that John turned both of the skeletons, who
spent several rounds trying to uselessly climb up the east wall of the
pit, while James, John, and Grimmin tried fruitlessly to hit the
skeletons, seeming to fling their weapons repeatedly into the corners
of the pit.  Eventually they managed to kill the skeletons.  James
decided, looking at the green-daubed keyhole, that it was larger than
any of the keys they had found so far, and probably hooked up to some
mechanism, rather than a lock for a door, and that whatever it might
be, it was beyond his current skill.

They crawled back up out of the pit, and one of D.B.'s characters (I
think it was John) tried to step around the corner to the north
corridor, which tilted and dumped him back into the pit, for more
damage.  Next they explored the western end of corridor **3**, where
James set off the arrow trap, which luckily missed.  They went in to
the crawlspace in **5** with Grimmin in the lead and he killed the
skeleton with ease!  They came out of the crawlspace into **6**, a
long narrow room with 12 coffins.  T.A.'s characters went to look at
the 4 open coffins and were attacked by two ghouls and a skeleton from
room **7**.  D.B.'s characters, more cautious, had stayed by the
crawlspace, but moved up to help their comrades.  Luckily, the ghouls
attacked Arlow and Elsie, who as elves were able to ignore the
paralyzing effects of the ghouls.  The resulting fight destroyed the
ghouls and the skeleton.

.. note:: For some reason I think the first fight in the sarcophagus
   happened right after the fight with the ghouls, but my notes say
   it happened in the second session.  I'll put it both places for
   now. 

They decided to open one of the closed stone coffins, and while
pushing the heavy lid off, Elsie, along with several others, fell into
the coffin on top of the skeleton.  The others managed to (eventually)
exit the coffin, but poor Elsie was too entangled with the skeleton.
Eventually the party killed the skeleton, but Elsie ended in the
negative hit points [#negative]_, so they went back to
Mad Sammy's with Elsie on a floating disk to recover.

.. [#negative] *Negative hit points*: I've been using a house rule that the
   characters don't die until they hit –CON.
