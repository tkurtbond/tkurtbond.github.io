Actual Play
===========

Went to **F**, where Dooley didn't notice the new pin-type poison
trap.  He made his save and was unconscious for 15 minutes.  After
that he disarmed the trap and moved the bar and pushed the door open
with a ten foot pole, knocking over the stack of noisy items.  5
hobgoblins came from **26**, while 1 warned **27**.  Killed all 5 and
were standing over the bodies when 6th hobgoblin showed up, saw the
massacre and ran back to **27**.  PCs ran after them.  (BTW, already
used up both of their healing spells.)  Dooley checked door of **27**
for traps and then they opened the door and rushed in.  They were
surprised by 6 hobgoblins hiding behind various rocks.  Curufin was
taken to 0 HP in the first round.  Eventually killed all the
hobgoblins.  Searched and Jeffry found the secret door!  3 hobgoblins
with scale and mace, three with shied, scale, and longsword.  7 sp 4
ep 4 sp 4 ep 4 ep 4 sp 7 ep 5 sp 2 ep 5 sp 5 ep 4 sp 5 ep.  

They decided to rest overnight in **27**.  Set up 5 watches.  **31**
attacks on watch 3 (Jeffry, Dooley, Guards 1 & 2).  **23** attacks on
watch 4 (Dru, Jeffry, Taffy, Guard 1).  Hobgoblins from **28**\ —\ **31**
came in 1st rush, except females from **30**.  All died eventually.
After that females from **30** came and were killed.  Glen down to 0
HP.  Dru found secret door at other end of 20 foot corridor.   Dru and
Taffy stayed to watch their unconscious comrades.  They searched the
rooms beyond and found the false bottom of the iron chest, but Dru
and Taffy heard a noise beyond the barred door and Taffy ran for the
others.  The hobgoblins burst through just as Dooley ran back, jumped
the barrier, and poured a healing potion down Curufin's throat.
Curufin woke up confused, the hobgoblin's threw javelins, Dru was
injured, Dooley was taken to negative HP.  Then next round initiative
was simultaneous, Dru injured more, Curufin used their fireball
scroll, killed all the hobgoblins.  Dooley and Glen are unconscious. 

Next Morning: Glen 1 HP, Dooley 2 HP.  Curufin, Taffy, and Alice go
back to town.  100 GP deposit for team and cart, 20 gp rent.  Jeffry
pays 1 gp each for the guards' funerals.
