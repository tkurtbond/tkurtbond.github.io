   We're playing *B2 — Keep on the Borderland*, so if you haven't
   played that you might want to skip this entry.

I got to run another short Labyrinth Lord session for the kids_.

Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.
+ M.A., playing *James the Cleric* and *Jeffrey the Monk*.
+ T.A., playing *Glen the Strategist* (a wizard) and *Dooley the sly* (a thief).
+ L.B., playing *Taffy the Halfling* and *Alice the Cleric*.
+ E.A., playing *Curufin the Elf* and *Drusilla the Ranger*.


More Orcs
=========

C. Net: 2 rounds.  Killed male orcs from rooms 14 (9 orcs) & 15 (6
orcs) at the entrance.  Dooley, Jeffry, & Alice went to below zero
HP — Alice healed Jeffry, James healed Alice, and James bandaged
Alice's wounds.  Looted bodies and fled.

(This appears to have been the first session recorded in my moleskine.)
