Actual Play
===========

After some time off to heal, they came back to **F** and expored,
leading to **17** and the goblins.  6 goblins, 3 HP each and a 25 HP
ogre.  (And them without the fireball scroll they'd been hoarding to
take care of the ogre!)  They don't have any problems, though, and the
ogre falls.  They search around and find the secret door, and stab his
bearskin rug!  They find all his booty and return to town.

They come back to the Caves of Chaos and attempt **H**, the bugbear
lair.  They follow the east corridor to **38**, where they use *sleep*
to put down some of the bugbears.
