Actual Play
===========

**1st day:** They found the crypt doors locked again.  Pick Locks
failed, so they went back to the Temple.  Hermes: Red Stone. James:
Key, so /bite (he immediately dropped the key, so was only bitten
once), then Blue Stone.  Zedd: Gray Stone. John: Key, so Bite (and
dropped the key).  Arlow: Gold Stone.  Elsie: Green Stone.  Grimmin:
Key.  Since some were injured they went back to Mad Sammy's, go
thealed, and slept.

**2nd day:**  Back to crypt.  Door in room **2** was locked again and
when they opened it they surprised 8 giant rats.  R1 rats surprised,
Leanna and Grimmin step forward and attack, killing 3 rats, while the
rest of the party falls back and takes position in room **2**.  R2
Hermes casts *sleep*, sending the remaining 5 rats off to their last
slumber, then the rest of the party coup-de-graced the rats.  They
decided to pick them up on the way back out to smoke-dry for rations.
Off to area **4**, the pit.  Wandering Monster: 4 skeletons in the
pit.  They animate when James starts down into the pit.  John turns 5
HD, so all the skeletons tried to flee over the north edge of the pit,
which repeatedly dumps them back into the pit.  It takes the party 6
rounds to destroy the skeletons, but James took 4 wounds and fell
unconscious. Zedd had the Green Rod Key.  He put it in the
green-daubed hole and pulls upward.  Everybody hears the click.  He
takes the key out.  The party members in the pit climb out on the
north side, which now *doesn't* dump them back in the pit, and the
rest of the party steps around the corner from the west site of the
pit.  Leanna picks up James and carries him, and they all head off to
the door to room **11**.  

.. Wandering Monster: Dwarf, 3 HD, Reaction Roll 9, Hostile.

They had reached the doors when they noticed, coming up the hallway
behind them, a rather surly looking dwarf.  After an exchange where
the dwarf insisted they shouldn't be here and tried to intimidate them
into leaving, he turned and left.  T.A. immediately has Arlow (?)
agitating for the party to attack the retreating dwarf.  Upon learning
that the dwarf is wearing plate mail, Grimmin and Leanna fire their
crossbows at the dwarf, and Arlow joins in.  They score one hit, but
the dwarf steps round the corner over the pit, and Arlow, Grimmin, and
Leanna chase after him.  They chase him in the dark until he vanishes
out of their range of sight at the bottom of the stairs in room
**10**.  They hesitate at the top of the stairs, Leanna retreating to
find the others, and Grimmin and Arlow hear a scream in the room
below, then sounds of struggle, then silence.  They wait, listening,
and then Grimmin is surprised by the shadow and taken to –1 HP in the
first attack.  Arlow picks up Grimmin and flees to room **2**, where
they paused.  The others (carrying James) are already in room **2**.
Here they are all surprised again when *2* shadows attack!  The
shadows attacked Arlow (and missed) and Zedd (and hit).  In the second
round the shadows attacked Hermes (and missed) and Leanna (and hit).
Party fled and left crypt door open.

They spent two days just resting and healing.  Every night they had
wolves howling outside and clawing at the Mad Sammy's cellar door.
Mad Sammy shrieked and howled, babbling that they had offended “the
eye”.  On the third day some of them hunted, because their supplies
were gone and Mad Sammy's supplies were running low.  They found
enough to feed four people for the day.  On the fourth day they found
enough food to feed three people for the day.  On the fifth day John
was able to heal Leanna of the last of her wounds, and the party was
finally completely healed.  On the sixth day they found enough rations
for 12 people, and after eating had 3 days rations to smoke dry that
evening. 

On the seventh day they headed back to the crypt.  They went directly
to room **11**, where they were surprised by 2 ghouls hidden in the
loose dirt near a ¾ buried chest.  Grimmin was paralyzed on the first
round (for 7 rounds), but the rest of the party was able to kill the
ghouls in three more rounds.  John cast *cure light wounds* on
Grimmin, which also cured his paralysis.  Leanna took the magic flail,
and Hermes took both scrolls.  Back to mad Sam's, where there were
still wolves at the door every night.

Reflections
===========

I made an effort this time to follow the `Labyrinth Lord` Labyrinth
Play Sequence, Time and Movement, Rest, Monster Reaction, Wandering
Monsters, and Morale Checks rules more closely than I have
hitherto.\ [#back-in-the-day]_ The dwarf was a wandering monster roll,
straight from the Level 1 column on the Wandering Monster Table on
p. 104 of `Labyrinth Lord`, with everything after that improvised on
the fly — I decided he was another treasure hunter, upset at finding
competition, and once he started to flee the PCs it seemed inevitable
that he end up in the room with the shadow, and get killed and turned
into a shadow himself. I thought it added a lot to the game, and made
me look on wandering monsters with much more approval.  I do think
that I ought to make location-specific wandering monster tables,
though.

.. [#back-in-the-day] I don't remember how closely I used to follow
   AD&D's equivalents back in the day when I primarily played AD&D.
