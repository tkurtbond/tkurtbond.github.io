I had to upload a document to scribd.com the other day to get a
document out of their archive, so I uploaded my notes for my Savage
Worlds adventure “Return to the Frontiers of Alusia”, a revised
version of a GURPS adventure I ran in 1988 in the `DragonQuest`
setting `Frontiers of Alusia`.  Anyway, today I uploaded__ a revised
version that has my hand-drawn maps from the original 1988 version.

I found this post today while doing maintenance on my blog, and
realized that I've long since decided I hate scribd.com and think it
should not be used.  So I deleted the few documents I'd uploaded
there, including this one, and I'm hosting it here_ instead, updated
with some additional comments on where I got my ideas for it.

Later on I started a Savage Worlds campaign set in The Frontiers of
Alusia with some of the same players but with different characters — I
lost the character sheets for the characters that played this
adventure — so now I call that campaign “Return to the Frontiers of
Alusia” and this adventure “Return to the Frontiers of Alusia Precursor”.
