Today I got my copy of James Raggi's `The Random Esoteric Creature
Generator`, published by Goodman Games.  In general I like it.
However, I do have two criticisms.  

+ First, and most important, to the publishers: black text on a gray
  background with white lines is **much** harder to read than black
  text on a white background with black lines  **Please, please, please,
  don't do this.  It doesn't make your book look any better, and it
  just irritates anybody with less than absolutely perfect vision!**

+ Second, to the author: In the Basic Body Shape table, on pages 6
  through 7, in the Polyhedron sub-table you missed the obvious: the
  **Icosahedron** shape should occur on a roll of 20.
