Notes for the WVHTCF 50 Fathoms Campaign
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

  .. role:: skill

  .. |50F| replace:: `50 Fathoms`_
  .. |PEG| replace:: `Pinnacle Entertainment Games`_
  .. |SW|  replace:: `Savage Worlds`_

  We're playing |PEG|\ 's |50F| `plot point`_ setting using the |SW|
  system.  (The `Test Drive`_ gives you most of the Savage Worlds rules
  for free.)

  .. _`Test Drive`: http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/SWEX/TD06.pdf

* We're using the `Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition`_ for our main rule book.

* We're using any of the edges and hindrances from
  `Pirates of the Spanish Main`_ (also known as
  `PotSM`) and some of the updated ship rules as well.

* We're using the :skill:`Knowledge (Navigation)` skill from `PotSM` for
  navigation (instead of |50F|\ 's :skill:`Boating`), but using the 
  :skill:`Boating` skill for all other ship handling.

* Ships wishing to sell found treasure need a **1000$ Salvage license**.

* Privateers get a **bounty of 50% of the value** of a lawfully captured prize.

  (In unusual circumstances, head money may be offered.)
