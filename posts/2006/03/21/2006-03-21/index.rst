+ *Sand of the Arena*, *A Gladiators of the Empire Novel*, by James
  Duffy; McBooks Press, 2006.  Interesting.
+ *The Queene's Cure*, *An Elizabeth I Mystery*, by Karen Harper;
  Delacorte Press/Random House, Inc., 2002.  Strained my suspension of
  disbelief a bit, always a problem when famous people are main
  characters in a novel.
