+ *Maeve*, by Jo Clayton
+ *The Fatal Fashione*, by Karen Harper; Thomas Dunne Books/St.
  Martin's Minotaur/St. Martin's Press, January 2006.  Using historical
  persons as main characters is always chancy, and using them as main
  viewpoint charactacters even more so, but in this series it seems to
  work ok, as far as my limited knowledge can tell.
