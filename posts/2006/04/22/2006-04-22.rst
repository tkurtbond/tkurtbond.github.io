+ *The King's Treasure*, *The Falcon #4*, by Mark Ramsay; Signet/The
  New American Library, copyright 1982, 1983; March, 1983.

  After reading the first three `Falcon <link://slug/2006-04-04>` books,
  I did some looking on-line and found the fourth book.  It turns out
  that Mark Ramsay is a `pen name
  <http://www.iblist.com/author12965.htm>`__ for John Maddox Roberts.
  This volume of the series contains the first chapter of *Falcon #5*,
  *Greek Fire*, but I haven't been able to find any proof that #5 was
  actually printed.
