Well, I certainly got in a lot of gaming *this* weekend!

Today was `D&D`_: my nephew D.B. D.M.ed the concluding session of our
run through the `Wizards of the Coast`__ adventure “Scourge of the
Howling Horde”.  Great fun was had by all.  I especially enjoyed being
a player rather than D.M.  Kids_ attending were L.B., D.B., T.A., E.A.,
and M.A.

    I'll edit more actual play details into this post when I've got a
    moment and my notes are handy.
