I enjoyed the new Indy film, *Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the
Crystal Skull*. It had a few flaws, and it wasn't as good as either
the first or the third, but it was fun.  I happened to run across a
blog post today that essentially thought it wasn't worth seeing
because Indy was old.  That's actually one thing I liked about it:
it's nice to see an old action hero occasionally.
