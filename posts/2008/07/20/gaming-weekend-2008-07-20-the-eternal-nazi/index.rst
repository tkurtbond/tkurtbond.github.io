Actual Play
===========

Savage Worlds
-------------

Second, I ran `“The Eternal Nazi”`_, a `Savage Worlds`_ pulp one-sheet
for them.  Like many of the one-sheets, it didn't come with a map, so
I made one a couple of nights before using printable PDF tiles.  The
kids_ had fun, but I can see why Kator the Ape Boy wasn't in the most
recent pregenerated pulp characters download intended for use with
“The Eternal Nazi”: as the sole melee-only character he was at a serious
disadvantage.

I think this was actually the first time I've used modern weapons in
Savage Worlds.  It went ok, although I did forget each shot on
auto-fire counts as three bullets expended.  I think I'll add some
grenades to the PCs gear the next time I run it, suggest the PCs other
than Buck pick up some of the germain submachine guns, and up the
number of extras with the big bad.

..  and make sure to set up a situation with strafing?
