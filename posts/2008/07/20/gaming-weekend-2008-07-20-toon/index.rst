Toon
====

First, by request, I ran a session of Toon_.  

.. note:: I ought to see if I can find my notes for this and see who
   was here.

Actual Play
===========

I set it in the “Old West in Space” and the toons had to rescue the
kidnapped daughter of the richest toon in town from the bandit
chieftan Big Ape, the “Fastest Banana in Space”, and his bandit gang
of monkeys, who were hiding out in an abandoned asteroid mine still
inhabited by mining robots.
