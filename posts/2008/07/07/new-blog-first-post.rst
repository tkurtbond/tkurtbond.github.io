I've been increasing dissatisfied with the complex of software I use
to create my web pages. Until I replace the whole thing with something
better I'm going to be doing things on this new blog.

This, by the way, is the actual first post.  Anything that is earlier
is backdated to the date it actually happened, and will be
(eventually) marked with the “timewarp” tag, and have a link to this
post.
