James Maliszewski `points out`__ that D&D always had “mook” rules:

    Under OD&D, a fighting man can attack a number of times equal to
    his level when facing foes of 1 Hit Die or lower. This rule
    carried over into AD&D in modified form, with multiple attacks
    being allowed only against foes of less than 1 Hit Die.

I'd completely forgotten that, if I ever knew.  That's tremendously
interesting.
