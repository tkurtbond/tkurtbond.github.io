I got to run the “Eternal Nazi” one sheet for *Savage Worlds* again,
for adults this time, M.A.H and C.A.H from my adult group.  We did
character generation for a new D&D campaign with the regular GM, who
then had to leave.  After that I ran “Eternal Nazi”.

It went ok, I guess.  It ran much longer this time, probably for 
several reasons:

 #. I added a new encounter to it.

 #. It was the first time the players had played *Savage Worlds*, and
    to complicate things they were each playing two characters.

 #. I was not at my best.  (Too little sleep, too much stress elsewhere
    in my life.) 

I think I'm going to run this for yet another group, so I'll discuss
the specifics of my changes to the adventure then.

The new maps did make things a little more interesting, although the
design of one did provide a great deal of advantage to the PCs.  I'll
have to rethink that.

I should really sit down and come up with some better tactics for the
BBEG. 

I was not at my best, so I kept forgetting the simplest things, and I
know I actually made a couple of serious errors with the rules. You'd
think that since I've been playing Savage Worlds for a while I would
remember.  In my defense, I was using a couple of sections of the
rules that I'd only used once before.  Still, I need to get more rest
before I GM something!
