The kids I game with get mentioned a lot.  Right now they're my
daughter and niece and nephews.  I'm really lucky to have such a great
bunch of kids around to play games.  (Some of the parents game
occasionally, and I'm glad to include them in the games, any time.)

L.B. 
    is my daughter.

My brother C.P.B. and his wife C.B. live about an hour away, so their
kids get to play semi-regularly.

B.B.
    is the oldest of the bunch, which means I've been experimenting on
    him the longest.  (|smile| I hope it hasn't hurt too
    much. |smile|) His first game was a `FUDGE` `Bunnies and Burrows`
    game; I think he was 5 years old then.

    He's married and off to college now, so we don't get to game
    together as much any more, alas.

D.B.  
    is the middle brother.

M.B.
    is the youngest child, and started playing well below reading age,
    so usually plays as part of a team with his dad or an older brother.

My sister C.I.A. and her husband J.W.A.II and their kids live on the
family farm, next door to me, so I get to run games for the A. kids,
along with my daughter, the most.

T.A. 
    is the oldest boy.

E.A.
    is his younger sister.

M.A.
    is their younger brother and is the youngest of my regular gamers.
    He can read now, and lots of fun playing.

C.A.
    is the new baby boy, and he recently_ started playing in our
    games.  He's very young yet, but seems to be having fun.

My brother N.A.B. and his wife K.Bâ€“B. live far out of state, and so
their kids only get to play on summer and winter vacations when they
come and visit the family farm, but I enjoy running games for them
when they are available.

T.B. 
    is N.A.B.'s oldest son.

O.B.
    is his younger brother, and started with `Buggin'`_, but now 
    plays `Savage Worlds` 

I'm going to try online gaming with a map tool and either a chat
inteface or a voice interface when the kids are a little bit older, so
the ones that are farther away can get to play more often.

I've run a lot of games for the kids; *Fudge Bunnies and Burrows*,
*BESM Dungeon*, *Toon*, *Buggin'*, *D&D*, *Savage Worlds*, and perhaps
others.
