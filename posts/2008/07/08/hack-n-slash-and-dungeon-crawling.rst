I find, when I've got little time or energy, that it is very easy to
fall back to `hack-n-slash` and dungeon crawling as the default types
of adventures to present for my players.  Admittedly, these days I'm
running mostly for kids who are happy to play in the intersection of
those styles.  Actual “roleplaying” happens mostly as the result of
serendipitous inspiration from in-game events (witness the
`cuirbouilli armor`_).
