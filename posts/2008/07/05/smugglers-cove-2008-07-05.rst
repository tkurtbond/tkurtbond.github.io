   Smuggler's Cove, PEG_

   .. _PEG: http://www.peginc.com/

Saturday after the 4th I ran another `Savage Worlds`_ game for the
kids_.  This time it was “The Secret of Smuggler's Cove”, lightly
adapted for the *Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition*.  

Attending
=========

* L.B., playing Amy and Josiah
* T.A., playing Billy and David
* E.A., playing Catherine
* M.A., playing Devlin

Actual Play
===========

The PCs in this adventure are all kids, and T.A. wasn't any too happy
that none of the characters had any weapons more effective than a
slingshot!  Still, they all had fun with the first two sections of the
adventure.  In the first they raced small sailboats, and they managed
to split the characters up so that all the characters run by the two
boys were in one boat and all the characters run by the two girls were
in the other boat, and each had fun taunting and distracting the
others.  I ran it as a chase and let good taunts and distractions
affect the *Boating* rolls of the two captains, and I let every
*success* and *raise* on the *Boating* roll move the boat one range
increment forward [#chase-and-ranges]_, which may not be strictly by
the book, but did allow for dramatic changes in position.  The girls
won on the last *Boating* roll, and then it was time to eat a picnic
lunch.  They observed the thug hide the map and papers, dug them up,
figured out the notes were in German, reburied them, followed the man
who picked them up back to Rydel Mount & figured out that he was the
gardener, headed back home (very, very, late), saw the Gypsies cooking
fire beyond the old Roman fort & traipsed over to see what was
happening.

.. There are notes on what bennies each character has in my “Current
   Gaming” notebook.  I have no idea where the character sheets and
   figure flats are, though.
    
.. Note:: This is a timewarp_ post.

.. [#chase-and-ranges] I think the actual rules move a range increment
   only for a *success* and the first *raise*.
