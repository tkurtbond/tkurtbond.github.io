<h4>Actual Play</h4>
<div class="section" id="drinking-before-the-festival">
<h5>Drinking before the festival</h5>
<p>It was the night before the spring festival, and the four friends
began the night at the local tavern, the <em>Broken Stone</em>, chattering
about the festival and what competitions they wanted to enter. A long
time rival of Onchu, Halrig (sp?) Hillfield came over and began
chaffing Onchu about the wrestling competition the next day, which
lead to Eirnin wagering 2 c.p. on Onchu vs. Halrig and Bartha treating
Halrig to a couple of drinks to continue him on his way to a
hangover. After that the friends moved outside to the pre-festival
celebrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="out-of-town-ruffians">
<h5>Out-of-town ruffians</h5>
<p>One or more of the friends noticed three out-of-town ruffians forcing
young Lochlan a'Niall down a street and behind a building, and when
shouting for Niall gave no result, the friends hurried after the
youngster and ruffians. By the time the ruffians were in sight again
they hand young Lochlan up against the building side and were beating
his precious coins out of him. Eirnin ran forward and got between the
wee lad and his attacker, the leader of the thugs, and got him to run
and find Sheriff Artair, while the others moved up and engaged the
hoodlums, one of whom brandished a club and attacked them. Droston, in
a rage, began beating the leader with a stick of firewood, while the
others looked to his followers. By the time Niall and Sheriff Artair
arrived the leader was bleeding on the ground, one thug had run off in
fright and the other had surrendered. After interrogating everyone
involved the Sheriff told the friends that they had done well and
carted the leader and the thug off to a root cellar for the rest of
the festival where they were joined the next day by the other thug,
found shivering on the doorstep of the Broken Stone after being
frightened out of the woods. (It turns out that Droston had really
done a number on the leader, broken bones and smashed his face enough
he was possibly looking at losing an eye. Nobody cared.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-festival">
<h5>The Festival</h5>
<p>The next day the wrestling competition was first in line. Onchu made
it through the necessary eliminations to fight Halrig Hillfield and
after a tense match won handily. Halrig, after recovering, declared it
was a good match and that he'd win next year, and paid Eirnin his 2
c.p. winnings without complaint. Continuing on the competition Onchu
was matched in the final bout with Coll, the reigning village
champion, and while he lost that bout Coll opined that Onchu had been
one of the best challenges he'd had for a while and with a few more
years under his belt would be a very interesting match.</p>
<p>After that Bartha won the sprint contest, and poor Onchu, barely
recovered from his bout with Coll, came in last. (Droston was
impressed that he was able to run at all after matching up with Coll!)</p>
<p>Eirnin won the distance run!</p>
<p>Droston was the runner-up in the Archery meet.</p>
<p>Eirnin came in third on the log chop.</p>
<p>Droston won the axe throw!</p>
<p>Bartha was the runner-up in the sling competition.</p>
<p>After that the friends just enjoyed the rest of the festival.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-to-work-on-monday">
<h5>Back to work on Monday</h5>
<p>The Monday after the festival, everybody went back to work. Droston
and Bartha were off hunting separately while Eirnan and Onchu were
setting out for work. Along the way, Bran McVoy of the Clan McVoy came
up to Eirnin and offered him a job running two of the McVoy wagons
into town, eventually offering Eirnin and Onchu 8 silver a piece, take
it or leave it, no damn bargaining because he'd just go and find the
next guy. Eirnin and Onchu accepted, Onchu cleared his day off with
his shift boss, promising 5 copper under the table, and they set off
to gather their gear and meet at the McVoy's stable.</p>
<p>Droston and Bartha, coming back into town loaded with game, met the
two and hearing of their adventure, decided to accompany them, no
payment besides the adventure needed. Bartha had everything she
needed, so she told her dad where they were off to and brought her
brace of rabbits for lunch. Droston ran back and dropped off his deer
and gathered his stuff, and then on the way back met his dad Seamus in
the street. His dad wasn't overjoyed at Droston's plans, but couldn't
deny Droston had already finished his day's work. He did tell Droston
that his cousin Brocc (who disliked crowds and therefore avoided the
village during festival), was due back in this morning from the alpine
pastures with his goat herd, but had not been seen yet, and although
it wasn't an immediate worry, somebody had to check up on him
soon. Droston promised to check the high pastures as soon as he was
back from town.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-the-way-to-riverton">
<h5>On the way to Riverton</h5>
<p>Once Droston caught up with the group they headed for town with Eirnin
driving the first wagon, Onchu the second, and Bartha riding a wagon
and Droston ranging alongside, scouting ahead and behind on occasion.</p>
<p>At lunchtime they stopped and cooked Bartha's rabbits and Droston
freely admitted she'd done the right thing bringing them along. After
that they continued along. Eventually they met one of the sheriff's
deputies, Deputy Han, returning from escorting the three thugs to
town. He told them of bad character from town, Roy, who'd killed
somebody over a card game and fled justice and was feared to have
taken to banditry and murder in the area. The friends promised to be
careful and not go looking for trouble, and continued on their way.</p>
<p>They reached the halfway camp that evening, but because they had the
wagons and horses they couldn't use the normal campsite, which was
reached by a narrow rope bridge across the river, and could only draw
the wagons up on the side of a wide area in the road and make camp
behind them. Unfortunately, a starving wolf attacked the horses during
Bartha's watch and before Bartha, Onchu, and Eirnin killed it, Bartha
was severly bitten. (Droston, tired out by his day of walking and
running beside the wagons, only woke up in time to see the aftermath
of the fight.) The wolf didn't seem to be rabid, just starving, but
Bartha needs some serious healing.</p>
<p>And that's where we left them.</p>
