So, for grins and giggles, last time my local gaming group met I
brought copies of the first three commercially published roleplaying
games for show and tell: Original *Dungeons and Dragons*; *Empire of the
Petal Throne*; and *Tunnels and Trolls*.  (The order of the last two
is debatable.)

The release of 4E and the choruses of “It's not real D&D” had actually
interested me in looking back at what D&D really was, so I bought PDFs
of Original D&D (from RPGNow_) and its supplements and printed them all
out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the original
form factor.

Listening to the Whartson Hall Gamers playing *Empire of the Petal
Throne* from the RPGMP3_ Community Podcast rekindled my interesting in
Tékumel_, so I bought a PDF of it from RPGNow and printed it.  (This
really drove home how much bigger and better presented EPT was than
OD&D.  Also, how even less Politically Correct it was.)

And `T&T`_ had been in my thoughts since Ron Edwards' wrote a series
of reports__ on__ his__ `T&T`__ game.  I played T&T a bit in my youth,
so I already had a copy of it, the 5th edition, so I let that stand in
for the 1st edition, a not unreasonable bit of flexibility, since T&T
seems to have changed much less over five editions than D&D did over
4.5 or so.

(Later: I can't imagine why I didn't bring my copy of FFE/QLI's
republication of the original Traveller Books 1, 2, and 3 along, and
have one of the first SF RPGs too!)
