I ran a short game of *Buggin'* with L.B., T.A., E.A., and M.A.  Their
bugs were at an opera premier (in a suitably rustic setting: the opera
house was made of thick grass stalks covered with leaves, with doors
of bark fragments) when some thugs tried to abduct a young lady VIP
bug.  They, of course, prevented it.  M.A. kept getting knocked onto
the stage, and every time he'd try to sing.  Eventually he sang so
badly that things started breaking and falling down around the
characters.

There's more to the story, but we didn't have time to take it any
further.  We'll pick it up again later.
