I've been hearing a lot of people saying, in effect, that 4E D&D
admits what kind of game D&D has always been and tunes everything for
that: butt-kicking tactical battle-mat kick-in-the-door, kill
everything, and take it's stuff gamist play. [#whatpodcast]_ Right now
I'm ignoring the later bit about what 4E does and how well it does it,
and looking at the earlier bit's claims about “the kind of game D&D
has always been”.  I'm not convinced.

This post, right now, is sort of a placeholder.  I intend to fill in
my history with D&D and look at the various editions of D&D that I've
got and see if they support the “the kind of game D&D has always been”
remark. 

As I've said elsewhere_ the release of 4E and the choruses of “It's
not real D&D” actually got me interested me in looking back at what
D&D really was, so I bought PDFs of Original D&D (from RPGNow_
[#wotc-kerfluffle]_) and its supplements and Chainmail and printed
them all out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the
original form factor.  I've read `Chainmail` and the three pamphlets
that made up the original D&D release (X, Y, Z) completely, and have
scanned the others.  (Oddly enough, I've still not got beyond scanning
4E.)

OD&D
====

The original version of D&D, along with some of its supplements, was
still available in some hobby shops when I started playing RPGs, but
the group I played with had was strictly AD&D, so I completely missed
out playing the original, as well as its follow-ons, the various
versions of Basic D&D.

Some of the retrogaming community has commented that the play
experience for this for this version of D&D is very different from all
versions that came after it.  From my initial reading, I agree.

Blue Box/Holmes D&D
===================

I got this boxed set for Christmas one year as a young teenager, and
was fascinated.  My box came with B2 — The Keep on the Borderlands.
The group I ended up with, however, played AD&D.  I think I ran this a
couple of times for my younger brother.  My original copy of the
rulebook walked off many years ago, but I picked up the reproduction
cheap a year or so after the anniversary.

Moldvay/Cook Basic/Expert D&D
=============================

I saw this in stores as a teenager, but never picked it up.

I bought a copy of the rulebooks (from `Noble Knight`_) at some point,
and can see why so many speak so fondly of it.  It is a clear, well
written presentation of the ideas from OD&D with the unevenness sanded
down.

Advanced D&D, 1E
================

This was my real introduction to roleplaying games, and continued as
the main game in the groups where I played until college, with
occasional bouts of Tunnels and Trolls.  We played mostly homegrown
campaigns; for some reason the AD&D modules didn't work as well for
us.

Red Box/Mentzer D&D
===================

I never got a chance to play Red Box, but I got the PDFs from RPGNow_.


Rules Cyclopedia D&D
====================

I heard a lot of folks extolling the virtues of the one-book RC D&D,
so I searched around a found a reasonably priced copy.  Well worth the
money.  This is without a doubt the most complete-in-one-book version
of D&D, at least until the `retro-clones`_.

Advanced D&D, 2E
================

When 2E came out I'd long since moved on from D&D, and had been
playing *DragonQuest* and *GURPS* for long while.  I played 2E very
briefly, just before 3E came out, with a guy who'd been on a 3E
playtest and hated it.

3E D&D
======

Completely missed playing this at the time, but have played a few
sessions during the 3.5E era with folks who played 3E.

3.5E D&D
========

I've played this a fair bit.
