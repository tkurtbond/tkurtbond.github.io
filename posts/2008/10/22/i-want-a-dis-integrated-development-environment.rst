C.P. said: “I want a *dis*-integrated development envronment, not an
integrated development environment.”  I agree.

Microsoft's IDEs have always been about you adapting your working
style to their rigid idea of how that work should be done using their
monolithic tools.  Eclipse promises to let you add whatever
functionality you want to Eclipse, as long as you use their API (and
tools) and are willing to write a million lines of code.

That's not what I want.

I want to use the tools I find suitable to the job, and stitch them
together easily.  I want tools that work together, not get pasted
together.

   I like emacs, but I have no problem with acme.
