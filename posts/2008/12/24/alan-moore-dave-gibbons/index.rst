+ `Watchmen`, by written by Alan Moore, illustrated and lettered by
  Dave Gibbons, coloured by John Higgins; copyright Â© 1986, 1987 DC
  Comics, Inc.; Book Club edition; no ISBN listed.  Originally
  published in twelve issues in magazine form in 1986 & 1987.

  Knowing that there was a `Watchman` movie in the works, I decided to
  re-read the comic.  I enjoyed it again.
