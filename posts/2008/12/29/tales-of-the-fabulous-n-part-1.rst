   `“The Tale of the Fabulous Four”`_, TAG_

   .. _TAG: http://www.tripleacegames.com/


I haven't been able to get in as much gaming this holiday season as
either I or the kids_ would have liked, largely because I haven't been
able to prepare things.  However, we did get to play through part of
the `Triple Ace Games`_ free adventure `“The Tale of the Fabulous Four”`_.
Luckily, there were actually *six* pre-generated characters supplied,
since there were actually six kids playing.  It's set in Boston in
1915 and is about a bunch of kids who overhear some criminals planning
to steal a diamond and decide to thwart them.

Attending
=========

* L.B. playing Nancy Hestletwain
* T.A. playing Lucius Munroe
* E.A. playing Samantha Hardcastle
* M.A. playing Oscar Whitfield
* T.B. playing Arthur Abrahams
* O.B. playing Brent Hardcastle

Actual Play
===========

We played through Act 1 and Act 2, though I compressed much of Act 2
because we had a very limited amount of time for the session; I
skipped Scene 3 entirely, and wrapped things up completely
differently.

I was definitely off my game, and six screaming kids didn't help
things — for some reason I had more trouble keeping them settled down
and on track than usual.

There were some good moments, though, and I think the kids had fun.

As for the adventure itself, I had a few problems with it.  I suspect
that if I'd had more time to adapt it things would have gone better.
Oh well.  

We'll probably finish this off this summer, when T.B. and O.B. are
back visiting.
