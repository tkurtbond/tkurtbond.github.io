* `Farming As I Have Known It: 60 Years in Central Appalachia`, by
  S\. Thomas Bond, copyright 2007; first edition.

  This book, on farming and farm life, was written by my father over
  10 years in his spare time, and is an absolutely fascinating look at
  farming from the era of my great-grandparents and grandparents
  through to the present day.

  Although I grew up on a working farm and spent most of my time
  before I graduated from college working on it, I was never as deeply
  involved with farming as my father, something I now regret deeply.
  This book gives a very good idea of the determination, hard work and
  deep thought required to build and keep a family farm in West
  Virginia.

  Dad had copies of this printed and some of them were Christmas
  presents for us for 2008.

  The book is available on the web__.
