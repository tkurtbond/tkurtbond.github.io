I was very pleased to discover large parts of µstr_ compile and seem
to work under VMS v5.5-2 with GCC 2.7.1, which is almost the only
compiler available to me on that machine.  The other is VAX BASIC,
which has adequate simple string handling, but lacks advanced string
handling and has only very painful facilities for dynamically
allocating complex data structures and working with them.
