Recap
=====

Last time out the kids had lost their ship, lost the treasure, and
deposed their captain.  They'd had to build themselves a new boat to
escape the once-cursed island.

Actual Play
===========


This time out I decided that they'd forced by their dismal economic
situation into working for another pirate delivering smuggled goods,
and ran them through the *Pirates of the Spanish Main* one-sheet_
`Smuggler's Song`_.

They did pretty well, though they did end up running from the watch
several times.  And they mostly got paid.

Amusingly, my sister was not happy when they told her they'd been
fighting in a bar, so I've promised to steer closer to a “G” rating
next time…
