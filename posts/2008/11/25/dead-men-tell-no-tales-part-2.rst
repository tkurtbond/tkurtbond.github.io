I ran another session using the the *Pirates of the Spanish Main*
one-sheet “Dead Men Tell No Tales” with the kids_.

E.A. couldn't attend, but L.B. could, so she played Phillipe Gujon and
Alice Pettigrew, and out of deference to her dislike of playing
“boys”, it was revealed that “Phillipe” was actually “Phelicity”!

So, the roster was:

* T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel, Captain of the Lady Faire
* M.A. playing Scarred Jack
* L.B. playing (as her main character) Phelicity Gujon and (as her
  secondary character) Alice Pettigrew

We picked up a couple of days from the island on the map.  Not liking
the look of the decayed dock, they anchored offshore and left the crew
to guard the sloop.  On shore they found everybody 50 years dead.
They easily found the mine, ignored the skeletons wrapped in pirate
flags, and were shocked to find the lady hanging above the treasure in
the depths of the mines.  And of course, they were then attacked by
the six skeletons wrapped in pirate flags.

T.A. was plagued by poor initiative card draws and low rolls, and
earned the unhappy nickname “Captain Slowpants”, and eventually ended
up “Captain Slow-anything”, much to his dismay.  Eventually, however,
they managed to kill the skeletons, and that's where the game ended.
(We only had a short time to play.)

Reflections
-----------

We played in my living room around a low, 2 foot diameter table,
keeping dice, tokens, and cards on the table and character sheets
off.  We didn't bother to user miniatures.  I used gaming stones to
represent wound and shaken statuses, and check track of the skeletons
just by removing the d6 that I rolled for their fighting attacks, so
there was no book keeping.  I thought that all worked well.  

(My bones and joints, on the other hand, did *not* work well when
getting up off the floor after a couple of hours of play.)
