* `Non-Stop`, by Brian W. Aldiss, Copyright 1958, 1959, 1987 by Brian
  W. Aldiss; Carroll & Graf, 1989; bookclub edition.

  This was actually homework for a `Metamorphosis Alpha` game I intend
  to play with the kids_, but quite enjoyable.  I thought I might have
  read it before, but I certainly didn't remember any of it.  (Did I
  read it as a kid myself?  Quite possible.)

  Now I need to find more generation ship novels and movies.  Any
  suggestions?
