I ran the first part of the Savage Wolds fantasy one-sheet “Tomb of
Terror” for the kids_ after we got done with farm work.

Attending
=========

Around the table, starting with me as the GM at 6 o'lock, going
clock-wise: 

* M.A. played Gar IronHelm; 
* E.A. played Merula Lanus;
* B.B. played Marcus Two Hands (when he wasn't helping out with baby C.A.); 
* D.B. played Ramel Ramelson; and 
* T.A. played Fox.

Actual Play
===========

We got through the first encounter with very little difficulty,
largely because I forgot the very important surprise packages the
zombies had that should have gone off when they died, and then nearly
had a TPK_ when I set them all off at once.  They got to where they
could hear the next encounter when we had to quit.

Maybe we can finish this at Thanksgiving.
