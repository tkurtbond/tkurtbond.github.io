* `Kull: Exile of Alantis`, by Robert E. Howard, copyright 2006 Kull
  Productions, LLC; illustrations copyright 2006 Justin Sweet; Del Rey
  Books/The Random House Publishing Group/Random House, Inc.; first
  printing; ISBN 0-345-49017-7.

  Well worth reading, and not just as a precursor to Conan.  The essay
  “Atlantean Genesis” by Patrice Louinet, included in the book, argues
  on p. 288 that with the three Kull tales that were published during
  Howard's life, Howard had invented a new literary subgenre: “Heroic
  Fantasy”, “Epic Fantasy”, or “Swords and Sorcery” by modernizing
  fantasy through eliminating “…the chivalrous aspects, the flowery language,
  and stilted personalities, writing violent tales in a realistic
  style…” and that seems reasonable.
