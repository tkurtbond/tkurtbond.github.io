Introduction
============

Unfortunately my notes for this session aren't very good.  I'm not
*entirely* sure if everybody who played the previous session was here
to finishing the adventure off in this session, but I think so,
because L.B. was here and all the pre-generated characters for this
one-sheet were in use.

Attending
=========

+ M.A. played Gar IronHelm; 
+ E.A. played Merula Lanus;
+ B.B. played Marcus Two Hands (when he wasn't helping out with baby C.A.); 
+ D.B. played Ramel Ramelson; and 
+ T.A. played Fox.
+ L.B. played Serena, Aevakar Priestess (from the *Shaintar: Immortal
  Legends* free download *Heroic Archetypes*)

L.B. joins the group with a shiny new character
===============================================

L.B. was here, and wanted to play, of course.  Since all the pregens
were in use, I pulled out the characters from the *Shaintar: Immortal
Legends* free download *Heroic Archetypes* and had her look through
and see if she liked anything.  She found Serena, the Aevakar
Priestess, and fell in love.  (L.B: “Look!  An *Angel!*” T.K.B.:
“Well, not an angel, but she is magical and can fly…” L.B. “Cool!”)  I
swapped out a few *Shaintar*-specific items and adjusted her XP up to
match the “Tomb of Terror” pregens, and we got down to play.

Actual Play
===========

Like I said, my notes for this game were…not good, so I don't have
much to report.  I do remember that they tried to burn the obviously
magical journal of the insane necromancer, which put out a poison
cloud that forced them to evacuate the village, and L.B.'s character
Serena got to fly above the evacuees and make sure they were headed
away from the poison cloud.  

The `kids <link://category/gaming/actual-play/the-kids>`__ seemed to
have fun, and L.B. really wanted to play with her character again, so
we might come back to these characters at some point.  Certainly I
have my doubts as to whether the journal could be destroyed by a
simple fire…
