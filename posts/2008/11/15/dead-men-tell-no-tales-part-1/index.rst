Some of the kids_ and I played through about half of the *Pirates of
the Spanish Main* Savage Worlds one-sheet “Dead Men Tell No Tales”
this afternoon and evening, before and after supper.  This is one of
the free downloads `Pinnacle Entertainment Group`_ did for the game.

They found the dying pirate with the chest manacled to his foot, and
after he died opened the chest and found the treasure map, and decided
to head for the island.  Along the way they found and boarded the
decaying pirate ship, from which they deduced had come the dying
pirate.  They had a hard time with the zombie pirate captain wildcard,
who had the luck of the initiative most of the time, ending up with
the Joker *three* times, and the high card of the draw most of the
rest of the time.  The zombie wildcard incapacitated Alice with one
blow that ended up doing five wounds at a whack, and things were
looking dire.  However, the zombie pirate captain's luck with the
iniative cards finally left him However, E.A., rolling for the crew
extras who showed up after hearing Alice scream as she went down, aced
an attack roll, then aced all three of the damage dice, and then aced
at least one of the rerolls, putting the wildcard down decisively.
After that M.A. had Scarred Jack try an untrained Healing roll and
aced it big time, so most of Alice's wounds got healed and M.A. wants
Jack to learn Healing for real now, which is neat.  After they
returned to their ship the other ship collapsed and sank.  They
decided to continue to follow the treasure map, even though a storm
came up.  Alice was unconscious for four days.  After couple of days
it was obvious that they and their ship were suffering from the curse,
and that's were we had to leave the game.

Lots of fun.

Reflections
-----------

I should have looked up all the details of the edges and hindrances
and wrote them on the kids character sheets, and on my copies, before
the kids came over for the game.  I had to do it while they were
there, and of course they wanted to get on to the gaming.  However, I
knew we'd be looking them up in the middle of game if I didn't.

We also need to play more often so I can keep the details in mind
better.  Maybe next weekend.
