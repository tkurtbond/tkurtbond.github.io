+ *Jhereg*, by Steven Brust, copyright 1983; Ace/The Berkley
  Publishing Group, April 1983; my copy is the 4th printing, July 1984.
  The 1st book in Brust's series about Vlad Taltos, Jhereg crimelord
  and assassin. Reading these books again after 20 years is like talking
  with an old friend, just like rereading Dumas's *Musketeer* novels,
  which is amusing, considing the connection between the *Vlad Taltos*
  books and Brust's *Khaavren Romances* books, which are explicitly
  modeled on Dumas's *Musketeer* books.
+ *Yendi*, by Steven Brust, copyright 1984; Ace Books/The Berkley
  Publishing Group, July 1984.
+ *On the Oceans of Eternity*, by S.M. Stirling, copyright 2000;
  Roc/New American Library/Penguin Puntam Inc./Pengiun Books Ltd, April
  2000. The 3rd and so far final book in the *Nantucket* series.
