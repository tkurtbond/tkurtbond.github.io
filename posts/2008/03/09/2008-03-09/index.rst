+ *Orca*, by Steven Brust, copyright 1996; Ace Books/the Berkley
  Publishing Group, March 1996, 5th printing. Interesting to find out
  more about Kiera. The interstitial letters and meetings between Cawti
  and Kiera are interesting, as is the back and forth between Kiera and
  Vlad's viewpoints, and it's typical that we'd find out about Vlad
  Norathar practically off-stage.
+ *Dragon*, by Steven Brust, copyright 1998; Tor/Tom Doherty
  Associates, LLC, first mass market edition November 1999. Vlad in an
  army? Unthinkable!
