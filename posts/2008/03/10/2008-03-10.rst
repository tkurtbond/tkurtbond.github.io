+ *Issola*, by Steven Brust, copyright 2001; Tor/Tom Doherty
  Associates, LLC, July 2001. I've got the first edition of this, in
  hardback, but I have the rest of the series in paperback. When I
  looked at the prices for the paperback version of this in March 2007
  at Amazon they were all above 30$US, which is absurd.
