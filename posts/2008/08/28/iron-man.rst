I saw Iron Man a while back, before I saw *Batman: the Dark Knight*.
I actually read Iron Man decades ago as a preteen and teen, but can't
claim any more than a casual acquaintance.  In any case, I ended up
liking the movie.   It didn't make some of the mistakes I thought it might.  I'm looking forwarad to the sequel.

I don't see many movies in the theatres any more.  I ought to keep
better track of which ones I've seen.
