I suppose in part it is because I simply reached the maximum level of
frustration with my previous set of tools that I could stand, and have
had to start looking at alternatives.  (Unfortunately, this happened
with a number of things all at once, so I'm looking for replacements
for several of the tools I use constantly.)

In part it is simply because I need more practice writing.  At one
point in my life I did a lot of writing, and fairly easily.  Of late,
it's been harder and has happened much less.  I need to get back into
practice.
