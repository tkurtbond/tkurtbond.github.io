One of the things I need to do before I'm ready to build a house is
simplify.  I've got a lot of accumulated junk — physical and
mental, real and virtual — that I need to sort through, decide what is
important, and get rid of the rest.  

As far as the virtual goes, I need to simplify the tools I use: the
software I use to maintain my web site and blog, the tools I use to
process e-mail, and so forth.

As far as real goes, I need to get rid of actual physical objects:
things I don't use, things I don't need to need to use.

The mental is much harder, but probably more necessary.
