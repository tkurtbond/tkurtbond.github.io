I'm slowly figuring out more about pyBlosxom_, and will eventually end
up with a reasonable set of blog tools.  This evening I've been
figuring out more about statically rendering my blog, which ought to
overcome the noticable lags when accessing my blog.  I haven't
switched the actual blog over to static rendering yet, but I'm getting
closer.  So far the incremental part doesn't seem to be working.

I considered moving to awb_, an AsciiDoc_-based Website Builder, but I
still find the reStructuredText_ markup slightly nicer.  If only there
was a good reStructuredText to DocBook_ path I'd have no qualms at
all.
