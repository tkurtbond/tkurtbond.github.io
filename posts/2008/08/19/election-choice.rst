I think that one of the main problems with U.S. elections is that in
many cases we don't actually have much choice.  The way that
U.S. elections are organized it is very difficult to vote for anyone
other than a Republican or a Democrat.  In many states getting on the
ballot is difficult for other parties, and even in the states where
it's easier the whole structure is set up to favour the Democrats and
Replublicans.

To fix this we need to level the playing field by making it easier for
alternative parties to get on the ballot, ensure that anybody can vote
for anybody on the ballot in the primaries without penalty â€”
regardless of political affiliation, allow the citizens to vote
*against* particular politicians, and eliminate the ability of
political parties to select candidates that contradict the popular
vote.
