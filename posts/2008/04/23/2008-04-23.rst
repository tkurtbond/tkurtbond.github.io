+ *The Paths of the Dead*, Book One of *The Viscount of Adrilankha* by
  Steven Brust, P.J.F., copyright 2002; “Publisher's Note” copyright
  2002 by Emma Bull; “Some Notes Toward Two Analyses of Auctorial
  Method and Voice” copyright 2002 by Teresa Nielsen Hayden; Tor/Tom
  Doherty Associates, LLC; First mass market edition August 2003, 3rd
  printing; ISBN 0-812-53417-4. Continuing his Dragaeran homage to
  Alexandre Dumas, in this, the first part of the third book of the
  series if you follow the author's numbering or the entire third book
  of the series if you follow the publisher's numbering, we are reunited
  with old friends hundreds of years after Adron's Disaster and
  introduced to new characters who link this series with his *Vlad
  Taltos* series. It's very nice to find out yet more about the history
  of Dragaera.
