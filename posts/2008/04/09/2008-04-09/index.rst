+ *The Phoenix Guards*, by Steven Brust, P.J.F., copyright 1991;
  Tor/Tom Doherty Associates, Inc., first edition August 1991, ISBN
  0-312-85157-X. This is the first book in Brust's fantasy homage to
  Alexandre Dumas, set in Dragaera, the empire he introduced in his
  *Vlad Taltos* series, but much earlier. We get to meet people who are
  pivotal in the history of Dragaera and contribute much to the Taltos
  books. Lots of fun.
+ *Antiquity*: *From the Birth of Sumerian Civilization to the Fall of
  the Roman Empire*, by Norman F. Cantor, copyright 2003; Harper
  Perennial/HarperCollinsPublishers; ISBN: 0060930985; Edition:
  Paperback; 2004-09-01. This book covers all of antiquity from the
  birth of Sumerian civilization to the decline of Rome and the rise of
  Christianity in 240 pages and does it surprisingly well.
