+ *Dzur*, by Steven Brust, copyright 2006; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
  LLC, November 2007. A chance to visit with an entertaining, if
  dangerous, old friend.
+ *Maxie's Demon*, by Michael Scott Rohan, copyright 1997;
  Orbit/Little, Brown and Company (UK), 1997. This is part of Rohan's
  *Core and Spiral* series, but this book features a new protagonist;
  Stephen Fisher does appear a couple of times in the book. When I
  bought these books second hand over the Internet in late 2007 or early
  2008, this was by far the most expensive to acquire, and it appears to
  be a U.K. edition; was a version ever published by a U.S. version?
