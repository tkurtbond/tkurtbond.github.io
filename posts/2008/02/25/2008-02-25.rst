+ *A Meeting at Corvallis*, by S.M. Stirling, copyright 2006; ROC/New
  American Library/Penguin Group (USA), September 2007. An excellent end
  to an interesting alternate history series. I'm looking forward to
  reading his followup series, which apparently begins with *The Sunrise
  Lands*, though I'll wait for paperback. I've found my copies of his
  *Nantucket* novels, though, and will be rereading them sometime soon.
