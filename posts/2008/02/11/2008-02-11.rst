+ *Dies the Fire*, by S.M. Stirling, copyright 2004; Roc/New American
  Library/Penguin Group (USA) Inc, September 2005. My copy is the 7th
  printing. This is an enjoyable post-apocalyptic novel, dealing with
  the efforts of various characters to survive and rebuild after a
  mysterious failure of post Industrial Revolution technology.
