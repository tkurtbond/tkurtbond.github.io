+ *Procurator*, by Kirk Mitchell, copyright 1984; Ace Books/The
  Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin Putnam, Inc, April 1984. My copy of
  this is, if I understand the copyright page correctly, the 2 nd
  edition of this; judging by the (non-)yellowing of its pages, it is
  much younger than my copy of its sequel, *The New Barbarians*. This is
  an alternate history, in which Germania became a part of the Roman
  Empire, and Joshua Bar Joseph was freed by the procurator of Judea,
  and thereby Rome never fell.
+ *A Choice of Destinies*, by Melissa Scott, copyright 1986; Baen
  Books/Baen Publishing Enterprises, June 1986. An alternate history in
  which Alexander turned west instead of east.
