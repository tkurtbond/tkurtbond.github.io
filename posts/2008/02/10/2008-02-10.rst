+ *Grimbold's Other World*, by Nicholas Stuart Gray, copyright 1963;
  Ace Fantasy/The Berkley Publishing Group; May, 1986. I've been reading
  this to my daughter at bed-time on-and-off for a while now, probably
  enjoying it more than she has; it's one of my favorite children's
  fantasy books. I'm pretty sure I borrowed a version from the library
  when I was younger.
