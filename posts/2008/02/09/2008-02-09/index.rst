+ *The Devil Inside*, by Jenna Black, copyright 2007; Dell
  Spectra/Bantam Dell/Random House, Inc., December 2007. Another
  “Paranormal Romance”, this one about Morgan Kingsley, a
  professional exorcist who ends up possessed.
+ *Lost and Found*, by Alan Dean Foster; Del Rey, May 31, 2005. Oddly
  enough, this is not the book I thought it was. (So, what other book
  about a human abducted to be a pet have I read?)
