On the advice of a coworker I tried out Chrome_; after a day I think
it has almost become my favorite browser.  If only it built on the
BSDs and Linux, and a had a noscript equivalent.  I wonder what
RSS/Atom reader will integrate with it well?  [2019-11-10: Turns out
it was Google Reader, which was eventually abandoned.  sigh.]
