  of `Rohan
  <http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/mike.scott.rohan/first_page.htm>`__'s
  *Spiral* books about Steve Fisher, a modern export executive who finds
  out that there is more to the world than he has hitherto encountered
  in his empty life.
+ *The Diary of a Napoleonic Foot Soldier*, by Jakob Walter; edited
  and with an introduction by Marc Raeff; copyright Doubleday, 1991;
  Penguin Books/Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 1993. (If I've understood the
  copyright page correctly, it's the 21st printing.) Fascinating account
  of three Napoleonic-era campaigns by a conscripted foot soldier of a
  Germanic vassal-state, including the Moscow campaign.
