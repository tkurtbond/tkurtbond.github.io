+ *Iron Kissed*, *A Mercy Thompson Novel* by Patricia Brigs, copyright
  2008 by Hurog, Inc.; Ace/The Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin Group
  (USA) Inc., January 2008. Another entry in Briggs' series about her
  shapeshifting coyote/auto mechanic, Mercy Thompson. It was interesting
  to find out more about her version of the Fae. I'm going to have to
  find those of her novels that I don't already have.
+ *For a Few Demons More*, Kim Harrison, copyright 2007;
  EOS/HaperCollinsPublishers, December 2007. This is the fifth in
  Harrison's engaging series about a witch/vampire/pixie bounty hunting
  trio.
