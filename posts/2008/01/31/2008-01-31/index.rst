+ *Halfway to the Grave*, *A Night Huntress Novel* by Jeaniene Frost,
  copyright 2007; Avon Books/HarperCollinsPublishers, November 2007.
  This book announces on the spine that it is a catagory “Paranormal
  Romance”. It's probably a little more to the romance side of things
  than I prefer, but still enjoyable.
+ *Usage Yojimbo*, *Book 1: The Ronin*, by Stan Sakai, copyright 1987,
  2007; Fantagraphics Books, eighth edition, March 2007. I'd long heard
  that Stan Sakai's *Usagi Yojimbo* series, featuring the eponymous
  rabbit bodyguard in an alternate Nippon of anthropomorphic animals,
  was a classic in the field. Having read the first collection of those
  stories I have to agree. I'll definitely be reading the rest.
