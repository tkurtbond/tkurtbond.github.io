+ *The Gates of Noon*, by Michael Scott Rohan, copyright 1992;
  AvoNova/Avon Books/The Hearst Corporation, May 1994. This is the
  second book in `Rohan
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_Rohan>`__'s *Spiral*
  series about Stephen Fisher. Interesting mixture of modern day, exotic
  east, seafaring, and fantastical creatures, places, and magic.
