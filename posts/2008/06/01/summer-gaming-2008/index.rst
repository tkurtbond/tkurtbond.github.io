One of the things I'm trying to do this summer is to actually run and
play more roleplaying games.  I play every month or so with an adult
group, though that has slowed down during the summer due to scheduling
conflicts, and usually play once every month or two with my daughter
and my niece and nephews, but I'd like to play or run more often.

I'd like to run a game for the kids every weekend, but I figure that
will be difficult to achieve.  We'll see.  All but one of the kids is
11 or younger, and one who plays occasionally (depending on what game
we're playing) is 6; the older one is in his mid-teens.  I've been
playing RPGs with them (and occasionally their parents) on and off for
several years, starting with *Fudge Bunnies & Burrows*.  Some of the
kids have played when some of they were 5 years old or even younger;
at that age I have the kids roll dice and handle all the rules work
myself; it works great.  When I run things I generally try to keep
things age-appropriate for the youngest in the group. They've all
played video games and are familiar with common fantasy and science
fiction tropes from the games.

Over a couple of years we've played *Big Eyes, Small Mouth* (2nd
Edition Revised) a lot, and *Bugging'*, and *D&D* some, and *Savage
Worlds* a lot.  A couple of the older kids have run *D&D* and *Savage
Worlds* adventures for me, one from a commercial module that was a
present and another other using dungeons built with Legos and Lego
figures as miniatures.  We've played through *BESM Dungeon* and
several *Savage Worlds* adventures (including some of the free
adventures and some of the *Savage Tales* pdfs) and are working our
way through a couple of *D&D* adventures.

It's hard to schedule time with all the kids together at the same time
as I have free time, and there's no telling before hand when the next
time we'll be able to play will be, so I tend to run adventures as
short campaigns.  I've never gotten to run a long campaign.  *BESM
Dungeon* and the currently running *D&D* adventure *The Sunken
Citadel* (updated for 3.5E) have probably been the longest running
games.  I'd like to run *Evernight* or *50 Fathoms* for them some
time.

I'd also like to run more board games: I've still never played
*Settlers of Catan*, despite having it for a couple of years.
