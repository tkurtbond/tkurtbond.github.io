My brother who lives out of state usually comes in from out-of-state
twice a year, once during the summer and once at Christmas.  One of
his sons is old enough to play Savage Worlds these days, and since I'd
given him, along with rest of the kids who were old enough, their own
copies of the *Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition* I wanted to make
sure we got to play some roleplaying games while they were in town,
especially *Savage Worlds*.

Running for kids is a lot different than running for adults.  One of
the kids is in his middle teens, but the rest of them are under 11 and
one is 6.  They're very enthusiastic when they're interested, but if
things slow down the younger ones (literally) wander off until things
speed up again.  They also have sometimes have a little difficulty
switching between the neat stuff that is happening and the mechanical
stuff we're using to make the neat stuff happen, which can make things
take longer than it should.  They all enjoy it, though, and it's
definitely worth doing.

Sometime I'd like to make some character sheets specifically for the
younger kids who don't read very much yet, with pictures of, for
instance, their sword and the dice they need to roll to attack and do
damage with it.

One of my nephews is very into a particular collectable card game, and
we didn't get a chance to play it this summer.  Maybe at the Winter
gathering.
