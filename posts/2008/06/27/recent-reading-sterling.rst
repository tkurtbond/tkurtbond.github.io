* `Schismatrix Plus`, Bruce Sterling

  I figured out part way through this that I actually read this before.
  (Or rather, the `Schismatrix` part of it, since it's a collection of
  a novel and some related short stories.)  Looking back at my log_,
  I'd actually read it *recently*, just 3Â½ years ago.  Worth
  rereading, though.  I found them thought provoking.
