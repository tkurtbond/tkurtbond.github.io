<section id="part-1-character-creation"><h2>Part 1: Character Creation</h2>
<p>On Staturday the <a class="reference external" href="../../../../../categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> made characters while I used one of the <em>Toon</em>
Adventure Generators to generate some adventure ideas and looked for
interesting NPCs in the <em>Toon</em> books.  T.A. created a helpful ghost
named Jim and took ghostbusters as his natural enemies. I'd rolled the
location to be a haunted house, so I told L.B. and E.A. they were
ghostbusters and gave them a ghost trap and proton guns, and told
T.A. that he was one of the ghosts haunting the house, a former
sailor, “Salty Jim the Ghost” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#only-temporary" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.  T.A.  was worried
that L.B. and E.A. would spend the whole time ganing up on him
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#hacknslash" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, so I told him that they would initially be at odds,
but later they would have to cooperate.  E.A. created Tanny the Ballet
Bunny and took gardeners as her natural enemy, so I added a garden and
gardener/caretaker to the haunted mansion, although they didn't get
used very much.  L.B. created Nicole the Chameleon.  I decided they be
facing an alien invasion and the Dough Boys would be the minions of
the aliens.</p>
</section><section id="part-2-the-haunted-mansion"><h2>Part 2: The Haunted Mansion</h2>
<p>On Sunday we actually got to play.  The ghost and the ghost busters
spent some time trying to make each other fall down, destroying much
of the foyer of the haunted mansion and turning up a plaque holding
the spirit of Prof Winterbottom, the missing owner of the mansion, who
in the course of a world spanning career had collected an enormous
collection of weird items from all over the globe and then disappeared
mysteriously.  Once the initial player-vs-player slapstick had wound
down I had a delivery truck crash through the front porch
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#man-w-a-gun" id="footnote-reference-3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and dump a load of cylinders of bread dough through
the front door of the house, which burst and combined into <em>Dough
Boys</em> from the <em>Toon</em> rulebook.  The PCs then fled down a long
corridor (on roller skates?) and crashed down the steps into the
basement.  I decided that the aliens would be extra-dimensional
octopus-faced Cthulhuoid monsters called “pluggoths” named for their
odd special effect of squeezing through any aperture (doors, mystic
portals, etc.)  as if it were a plughole only an inch in diameter.
The pluggoths were using The Dough Boys to open a portal to to Earth
in the basement of Winterbottom's mansion, since it was the only
building with the necessary density of weirdness, and planning to
launch their invasion using the house as a base.  Luckily the PCs were
hiding in the basement, and after the aliens did their inevitable
gloating and explanation of there plans to conquer the world and suck
out everybody's brains, it was up to the PCs to foil their schemes and
save the world.  After some entertaining efforts by T.A.'s Salty Jim
using bottles from the wine cellar as simultaneously triggered
cork-guns and playing on the octopus-faced pluggoths' fear of
fishermen things moved on to a climax.  E.A.'s Tanny the Ballet Bunny
had, unbeknownst to me, taken <strong>dynamite</strong> one of her possessions and
in a move echoing all those desperate <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> characters
proceeded to set an explosive trap for the pluggoths and the Dough
Boys.  Unfortunately, she failed her <em>Set/Disarm Trap</em> roll and the
resulting explosion completely destroyed the entire mansion, flinging
the PCs and Prof. Winterbottom's plaque high into the air.  Luckily
the pluggoths and their extra-dimensional portal did not survive the
blast.  All the PCs <em>Fell Down</em>, and Tanny fell down out of the sky
through the Gardener's chimney and right into his stewpot.  The End.</p>
</section><section id="remarks"><h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>I find <em>Toon</em> to be difficult to run: I feel a lot of pressure to keep
up the wacky slapstick humor we're familiar with from Bugs Bunny, the
Roadrunner, or Tom and Jerry, and frankly that's hard.  Moreover, I
find it hard to think up things to do.  Thank goodness <em>Toon</em> has a
number of “Adventure Generators”; they really help me come up with
ideas.  In any case, this episode became more and more a slapstick
Bugs Bunny cartoon Call of Cthulhu episode as it went on, with creepy
voices and noises and villains whose ambitions were only overmatched
by their slapstick weaknesses: I worked hard to keep things at a
Scooby Doo <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#first-three-seasons-only" id="footnote-reference-4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> level of creepiness, saving
only that the monsters weren't people in disguise but silly cartoon
creatures.  I was aiming at Bugs Bunny visuals and Scooby Doo
creepyness factor, but not forgetting the Tom and Jerry slapstick and
the Scooby Doo chase scene goofiness.</p>
<p>I wonder if <em>Toon</em> would be easier or harder with adult players?</p>
<aside class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<p>T.A. wanted to make sure that his character
could be other kinds of ghosts in other games, which I thought fit
in well with the many examples of recurring cartoon characters
taking on different roles in different episodes, so I assured him
that the “Salty” part of “Salty Jim the Ghost” was only for this
episode.  I also gave him some temporary <em>Shticks</em> to help his
ghost role.</p>
</aside><aside class="footnote brackets" id="hacknslash" role="note"><span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#footnote-reference-2">2</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>T.A.'s very much into hack-n-slash and kill the
monsters, and like the other kids hasn't internalized Toon's
Tom-and-Jerry-like “conflict between players is fun” attitude, yet.</p>

<p>Who needs a man with a gun to burst through a
door, when you can have a whole truckload of bread dough cylinders
burst through and explode?</p>
