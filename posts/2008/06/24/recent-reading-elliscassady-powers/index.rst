  Cassaday, Colorist: Laura Depuy with David Baron and WildStorm FX;

  It's been quite a while since I've read anything approaching a
  superhero comic with any regularity.  This is probably as close as
  I've come.  Very good.  I'll probably have to find and read the rest
  of the compilations.

  Press, 2nd printing; ISBN 1-59606-046-8.

  A slim pamphlet, containing one of Tim Powers' typically weird
  stories.
