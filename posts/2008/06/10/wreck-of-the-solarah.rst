   “The Wreck of the Solarah” is the example adventure in the back of
   the *Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition*, so if you haven't played
   that you might want to skip this entry.

  Pettigrew, Isaiah Kestrel, Phillipe Gujon, Scarred Jack


Actual Play
===========

I let B.B. make 18 bombs out of powder and kegs and nails, etc., from
the Solarah and blow up most of the village.  The PCs got away with
Isabella and two small chests of treasure.
