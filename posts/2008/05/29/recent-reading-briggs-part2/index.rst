* `The Hob's Bargain`, by Patricia Briggs, copyright 2001 by Hurog,
  Inc.; Ace Books/The Berkley Publishing Group/The Pengiun Group, 
  March 2001; 7th printing; ISBN 978-0-441-00813-1.

  I enjoy fantasy tales that revolve around regular people, rather
  than the high and mighty, and tend to sympathize (for perhaps
  entirely obvious reasons) more with farmers and blacksmiths than
  nobles and rich merchants.  In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this
  tale of magical post-apocalypse.
