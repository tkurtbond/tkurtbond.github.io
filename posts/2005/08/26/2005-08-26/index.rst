+ *Bite*; Jove Books/The Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin Group (USA)
  Inc; January 2005.

  + “The Girl Who Was Infatuated with Death”, by Laurell K.
    Hamilton, copyright 2005.
  + “One Word Answer”, by Charlaine Harris, copyright 2005.
  + “Biting in Plain Sight”, by MaryJanice Davidson, copyright 2005.
    I've still not read a book by Davidson, just this story and another in
    the anthology Cravings__, but they were ok.
  + “Galahad”, by Angela Knight, copyright 2005 by Julie
    Woodcock.  Not to my taste.
  + “Blood Lust”, by Vickie Taylor, copyright 2005 by Vickie
    Spears.  Also not really to my taste.

+ *Dead to the World*, by Charlaine Harris, copyright 2004 by
  Charlaine Harris Shulz; Ace Books/Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin
  Group (USA) Inc., May 2004.  This, on the other hand, was very much to
  my taste.
+ *Storm Front*, by Jim Butcher; ROC/New American Library/Penguin
  Putnam Inc., April 2000.  My copy is from the 7th printing. This is the
  1st book in the series *The Dresden Files*, which looks like it ought
  to be entertaining; I somehow completely missed it the first time
  through, so now I'll have to try and find the rest.
+ *Dead Witch Walking*, by Kim Harrison; HarperTorch/HarperCollins,
  May 2004. My copy is from the 8th printing. Also good.
+ *The Awakening*, by L.A. Banks; copyright 2003 by Leslie Esdaile;
  St. Martin's Griffin, January 2004.  This is the 2nd book of the
  *Vampire Huntress* series, and it's readable, but I'd put it a couple
  of ranks below Hamilton, Harris, Butcher, and Harrison. The first book
  is *Minion*.
