======================

emacs, oh wonderful emacs
-------------------------

While back `Daniel Barlow <http://ww.telent.net/diary/>`__ `explained
<http://ww.telent.net/diary/2003/1/#14.28515>`__ why emacs is the best
desktop environment he has used. I agree: emacs is the best desktop
environment I've used, too. (Forth, Lisp Machine and Smalltalk users
may be able to say different with reason, but few others.)



Lisp is small
-------------

These days, a full blow Common Lisp is a relatively small application:
`Starting CLISP to evaluate an expression <http://groups-
beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/df76d0d07a750854?hl=en>`__
takes only 2.5 times as many system calls as it takes ls to list a
single file.
