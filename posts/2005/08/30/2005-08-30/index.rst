+ *Forge of Heaven*, by C.J. Cherryh, copyright 2004;
  Eos/HarperCollins, July 2005. This is the sequel to *Hammerfall*, and
  I gather that the series is now known as *The Gene Wars*. Interesting.
  I'm looking forward to reading more in this series.
+ *Dragonspell*, by Donita K. Paul; WaterBrook Press/Random House,
  Inc., 2004.  Too much overt preaching. Would this have annoyed me when I
  was a youngster? I'll have to reread the *Narnia* books and see if
  they annoy me now.
