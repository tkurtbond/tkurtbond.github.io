Actual Play
===========

Two of the kids_, T.A. and D.B., wanted to play an RPG, so I pulled
out `Tunnels & Trolls` (5th edition).  They picked from the
pre-generated characters in the T&T box (I had photocopied them some
time before), choosing a Dwarf Warrior named Bjorn, two Human Warriors
named Hrolf (renamed Ralph) and Ragnar, and a Dwarf Rogue named
Sturri.  They ventured into “Trollstone Caverns”, the example dungeon
from the T&T rulebook, traveling through areas **1**, **2**, **12**,
and **11**, then back out the same way, as they had ended up pretty
wounded.
