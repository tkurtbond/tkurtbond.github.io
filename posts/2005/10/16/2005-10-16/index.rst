Well, it looks like `Mongoose <http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/>`__
is serious about their new version of `Runequest
<http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/home/runequest.php>`__. It's also
apparently going to be an “Open” system, so that publishers and
individuals will be able to able to produce new derived works using
the *Runequest* rule. Moreover, it's going to get its own treatment of
`Glorantha <http://www.glorantha.com/>`__, too. I sure hope this turns
out well, but I also hope it doesn't prove a problem for `HeroQuest
<http://www.heroquest-rpg.com>`__.
