Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Serenity <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/>`__, 2005;
  directed and written by Joss Whedon.  It was good.
+ `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
  <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/>`__, 2005; directed by Garth
  Jennings, based on the book by Douglas Adams with a screenplay by
  Douglas Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick.  Disappointing: it's like they made
  a movie out of the some of the same pieces as the book, but left out
  all the humour. Now I have to reread the books to make sure they're
  still funny.
