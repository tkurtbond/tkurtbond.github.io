Retroforth 8
------------

I've been playing a little bit with `RetroForth
<http://www.retroforth.org/>`__ `8 <http://retro.tunes.org/>`__ from
the daily builds, just under another OS right now, not the native
version, and the most useful thing I can say to someone just starting
out with RetroForth is to look at the very short tutorial:

.. code::

    $ bin/rf
    edit
    use lib/tutorial
    r


To save any changes, remember to use the w word.

To return to the regular forth interaction style use the exit word.

`Here <http://forthfreak.net/index.cgi?RetroEditor>`__ is a page about
the RetroEditor (red) at `forthfreak <http://forthfreak.net/>`__
(which has a gForth version of the RetroEditor), and a `here
<http://forthfreak.net/index.cgi?RetroForth>`__ is a page about
RetroForth in general.

Retroforth looks like a good place to get back into forth: it's small
and simple, as well as using some of the latest forth thinking: tail
calls, simpler control structures, and so forth. And it runs on
several operating systems as well as a native operating system itself,
so it should be convenient for experimenting.



Stupid Visual SourceSafe
------------------------

Visual SourceSafe has a command line, but it is incredibly annoying to
use. Among other things, it normally truncates its output at 80
characters wide or so, so to use in a script it you have to write the
output to a file and then mung that. Of course, the output format for
most of the commands is not particularly useful, so you have to mung
it up a lot before you can do anything useful.
