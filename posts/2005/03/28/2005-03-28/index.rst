Recent Reading
--------------


+ *Rajan*, by Tim Lukeman; Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1979.  This was
  the first of four projected books of oriental fantasy about the land
  of Khe'chin, but as far as I can tell only this one and *Koren* were
  actually written. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that Khe'chin
  was inspired more by Korea than China, but my ignorance of Korean
  history, culture, and legends prevents me from judging whether that is
  so or not. It's a pity that the series was never finished: Lukeman
  sets up an interesting background and situation. I might have read
  this one first during college, when I first had ready access to the
  Upshur County library, but I might have actually read it earlier in
  grade school or junior high when I might have borrowed it from the
  bookmobile. I re-read it because it was on the reading list of the
  *Sorcerer & Sword* RPG supplement, and it was well worth re-reading.
