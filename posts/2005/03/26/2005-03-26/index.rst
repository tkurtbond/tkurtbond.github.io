+ *Crystal Soldier*, by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller; Meisha Merlin
  Publishing, February 2005.  Another delightful *Liaden Universe* story,
  this time time the story of the progenitors of Korval. Aptly dedicated
  to one of my favorite people.
+ *King Dragon*, by Andrew J. Offutt; illustrations by Esteban Maroto;
  ACE, October 1980.  An odd book; the jacket copy and some internal
  references compare it to the Lost World novels of Doyle, Haggard,
  Burroughs, and Howard, but it doesn't have the same flavour at all.
+ *Tomoe Gozen*, by Jessica Amanda Salmonson, copyright 1981;
  illustrations by Wendy Adrian Shultz, copyright 1981; Ace Fantasy
  Books/The Berkley Publishing Group, 1st edition June 1981, 3rd edition
  March 1984. The first *Tomoe Gozen* book.
+ *The Golden Najinata*, by Jessica Amanda Salmonson, copyright 1982;
  illustrations by Wendy Adrian Shultz, copyright 1982; Ace, February
  1982. The second *Tomoe Gozen* book.
+ *Thousand Shrine Warrior*, by Jessica Amanda Salmonson,
  copyright 1984; illustrations by Wendy Adrian Shultz, copyright
  1984; Ace, March 1984. The third (and last) *Tomoe Gozen* book.  The
  *Tomoe Gozen* books were recommended in the *Sorcerer & Sword* RPG
  supplement's reading list and are definitely worth reading for those
  interested in fantasy inspired by Japan or Swords & Sorcery fiction
  in general.
