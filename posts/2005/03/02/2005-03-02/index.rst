I got my copy of `Guardians of Order
<http://www.guardiansorder.com/>`__'s new roleplaying game, 
`Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne
<http://www.guardiansorder.com/games/tekumel/>`__. This is the first
time since the original TSR Tékumel roleplaying game that there has
been an edition of the game that was complete and playable in one
book. While I haven't had time to read it completely I've skimmed
through it and it looks very good.
