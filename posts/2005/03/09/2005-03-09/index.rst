+ *Skeleton Man*, by Tony Hillerman; read by George Guidall; Recorded
  Books, 2004.  Enjoyable. It's been a couple of years since I've read
  anything by Hillerman, and I've obviously missed a few books. I'll
  have to go back and find the ones I've missed.
+ *Koren*, by Tim Lukeman; Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1981.  This was also
  one of the books on the *Sorcerer & Sword* reading list. I have read
  it before, but it was definitely worth reading again. I'd like to find
  *Ragan* and re-read it, too.
