+ *Ancient Light*, by Mary Gentle, copyright 1987; Roc, 1990.
+ *Marvel 1602*, written by Neil Gaiman, illustrated by Any Kubert,
  digitally painted by Richard Isanove, lettering by Tod Klein, cover
  art by Scott McKowen.  A very good reworking of the Marvel Universe at
  the end of the reign of Elizabeth I of England.
