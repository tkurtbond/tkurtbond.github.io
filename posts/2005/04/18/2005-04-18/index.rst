Recent Reading
--------------

+ *The Sea of Trolls*, by Nancy Farmer; read by Gerard Doyle; Recorded
  Books, 2004.  A good children's book, despite some new-ageish moments.

Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow
  <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0346156/>`__, 2004. Directed and written
  by Kerry Conran.  An interesting proof-of-concept: the visuals were
  good, but the story and acting didn't quite jell. Still fun, though.
