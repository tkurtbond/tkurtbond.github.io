+ *The Blackgod*, by J. Gregory Keyes, copyright 1997; Del
  Rey/Ballantine Books, May 1998.  Book two of the *Chosen of the
  Changeling* series. Very good.
+ *Pierced Heart*, by Robin D. Laws; Trident, Inc., 1996.  A good,
  though odd, novel set on the island of Al Amarja, the setting of the
  *Over the Edge™* roleplaying game and the *On the Edge™* trading
  card game from `Atlas Games <http://www.atlas-games.com>`__.
+ *Delta Green: The Rules of Engagement*, *A Cthulhu Mythos Novel of
  Personal Apocalypse*, by John Tynes, copyright 1999; Armitage House,
  February 2000.  An interesting novel using the setting of the *Delta
  Green* roleplaying game adaptation of the *Cthulhu Mythos* to the
  modern world of government consipiracies and sinister aliens.
+ *Wild Jack*, by John Christopher, copyright 1974; Collier Books, 2nd
  edition, 1991.  Another of Christopher's odd and depressing young adult
  SF books.
