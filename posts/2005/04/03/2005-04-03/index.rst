+ *Myth and Middle-earth*, by Leslie Ellen Jones; Cold Spring
  Press,Â 2002.  While not as fascinating as Tom Shippey's `The Road to
  Middle Earth
  <../../../log/2003/11/09.html#the-road-to-middle-earth>`__ and
  `J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century
  <../../../log/2003/11/22.html#author-of-the-century>`__ it does have
  some good bits.
+ *The Waterborn*, by J. Gregory Keyes; Del Rey/Ballantine, 1996. Book
  one of the *Chosen of the Changeling* series. A good story with a very
  interesting animistic world.
