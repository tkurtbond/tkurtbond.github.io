Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Children of Dune <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0287839/>`__, 2003;
  Directed by Greg Yaitanes, novels by Frank Herbert, teleplay by John
  Harrison.  I thought this and it's predecessor `Dune
  <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0142032/>`__ were well done adaptations.
  Now I'm going to have to reread the books.
