I'm not actually sure when I finished either of these, so I just
guessed at the date.

Recent Reading
--------------

+ *Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings*, by Lin Carter;
  Ballantine Books, first printing March, 1969.  I think most of Carter's
  analysis has been superseded by later studies, but he had a few
  interesting things. I found his summary of the history of early
  fantasy interesting, in particular the chapters entitled *Fantasy in
  the Classical Epic*, *Fantasy in the Chanson de Geste*, and *Fantasy
  in the Medieval Romance*, and *The Men Who Invented Fantasy*. The
  chapter *Postscript: After Tolkien* also discussed a couple of books
  that I very much enjoyed during my childhood and of which I'd
  forgotten the author, Carol Kendall, and titles, *The Gamage Cup*
  (1959) and *The Whisper of Glocken* (1965), so I was overjoyed to find
  that.

+ `Zatoichi no uta ga kikoeru
  <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143012/>`__, also known as *The Blind
  Swordsman's Vengance*, 1966. Directed by Tokuzo Tanaka, story by Kan
  Shimozawa, and scenario by Hajime Takaiwa.  A little more introspective
  than is usual for Zatoichi. Good.
