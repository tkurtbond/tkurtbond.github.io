+ `Kaze no tani no Naushika <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/>`__
  (1984), aka *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds*, 1984. Directed
  and written by Hayao Miyazaki.

Watched this with Lily *and* Eva, at Lily's request.  They both
enjoyed it. I enjoyed it even on this second viewing in a
week-and-a-half and third viewing in a month.
