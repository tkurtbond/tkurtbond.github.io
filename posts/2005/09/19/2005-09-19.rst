Neel Krishnaswami explains how *Heroquest*
`turns setting into rules effortlessly <http://www.20by20room.com/2005/09/heroquest_and_b.html#more>`__.

In one of the comments on that article, `Brand Robins <http://www.randomencounters.blogspot.com/>`__ said:

    I just remembered something I said to my Grave of Honor (A Game of
    Thrones with HeroQuest rules) group when we got started: "HeroQuest is
    really, really good at supporting your vision. If you know what you
    are doing, have a feeling for what you want, and push your narration
    then HeroQuest will support you better than just about anything else.
    If you don't have a good vision or feel, however, or if you're looking
    to have the system tell you what happens or suggest courses of action
    seperate from naration (as most games do) then you're going to be
    SOL."

    All of my actual play with the system has backed that up in my
    experience. When you go into HQ with a vision, a good flow of
    narration, and an understanding of what you are after it supports you
    brilliantly. It does not, however, particularly help you in developing
    those things if you don't already have them. Thus the frequent
    complaints (on RPG.net and similar) that it breaks down into a "bean
    counting game."

In an entry on his blog, Brand Robins talks about `medium
length/detail contests <http://randomencounters.blogspot.com/2005/09
