+ *Shakespeare's Christmas*, by Charlaine Harris, copyright 1998; Dell
  Publishing/Random House Inc., November 1999; reprinted by arraignment
  with St. Martin's Press.  These *Shakespeare* books are very good.
+ *Singularity Sky*, by Charles Stross, copyright 2003; Ace Books,
  July 2004.  Enjoyable. I'll have to look for other books by Stross.
