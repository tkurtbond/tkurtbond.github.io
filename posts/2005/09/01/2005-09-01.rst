Recent Reading
--------------

+ *Dead as a Doornail*, by `Charlaine Harris
  <http://www.charlaineharris.com/>`__, copyright 2005 by Charlaine
  Harris Schulz; Ace/The Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin Group (USA)
  Inc., May 2005.  I like Harris and Hamilton the best of the books I've
  read in this genre. Hamilton is perhaps a little more intense, but
  Harris is perhaps a little more moving. I'll have to check out
  Harris's *Shakespeare* novels, set in rural Arkansas, and her new
  series starting with *Grave Sight*.
+ *Shakespeare's Landlord*, by Charlaine Harris, copyright 1996;
  Dell/Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc., August 1997.  Ok,
  it's later, and I *have* checked out Harris's *Shakespeare* series,
  and so far it is good.

Templating Not Useful
---------------------

I was thinking about templating in web frameworks, and went back to
reread Avi Bryant's `Where are the templates?`__
where he explains why `Seaside <http://seaside.st/>`__ doesn't have a
default templating system, and I have to agree that templating doesn't
seem like the best solution.
