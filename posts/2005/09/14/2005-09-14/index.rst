Slow Times at Gold Rush Games
-----------------------------

I ran across a reference to a post from 2004 explaining `Gold Rush
Games <http://www.goldrushgames.com/>`__ `current plans`_.
It's a pity the roleplaying games industry is such a difficult place
to make a living.

Publishing On Demand
--------------------

I also ran across an article that gives some of the `reasons
<http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Features/03Wallace_PODEssay.html>`__
that Print-On-Demand hasn't been the success that many expected.

Savanti Books Edition of Dray Prescott Books
--------------------------------------------

The most recent `summary
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Kregen/message/16632>`__ of the
situation with the Savanti Books edition of the Dray is dismal but not
surprising.
