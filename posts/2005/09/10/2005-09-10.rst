Recent Reading
--------------

+ *Shapespeare's Trollop*, by Charlaine Harris; St. Martin's
  Minotaur/St. Martin's Press, August 2000.

Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events
  <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339291/>`__, 2004; directed by Brad
  Silberling, based on the books written by Daniel Handler, screenplay
  by Robert Gordon.  Good, although I haven't read the original books so I
  can't compare it to them.
