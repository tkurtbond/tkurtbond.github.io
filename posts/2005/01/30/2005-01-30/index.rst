+ *Mr. Timothy*, by Louis Bayard, copyright 2003; read by Mark Honan;
  BBC Audiobooks America, 2003; produced in by arrangement with
  HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.  An odd sort of sequel to Dicken's *A
  Christmas Carol*, dealing with Timothy Cratchet's attempts as a young
  adult to deal with the death of his father and the overwhelming and
  smothering benevolence of his kindly uncle Ebeneezer, along with a
  number of unpleasant murders of young girls in mid-19th century
  London. Despite my expectations and a really alarming verbosity I
  ended up rather enjoying this.
+ *Drumbeat*, by Dudley Pope, copyright 1968; Pocket Books, 1970.
+ *Ramage's Diamond*, by Dudley Pope, copyright 1976; Avon Books,
  January 1982.  I've enjoyed what I've read so far of Pope's *Ramage*
  books, and was happy to find this one in a local library, along with a
  number of other volumes in the series.
