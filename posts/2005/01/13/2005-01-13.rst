+ *The Buried Pyramid*, by Jane Lindskold; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
  LLC, May 2004.  I dragged through the first half (which is probably my
  fault) but found the latter half much easier going. Interesting nested
  heroquests and use of ancient Egyptian gods.
+ *To Weave a Web of Magic*, Berkley Publishing Group, July 2004.
