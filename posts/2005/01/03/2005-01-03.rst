+ *The Tombs of Atuan*, by Ursula K. Le Guin, copyright 1970, 1971;
  illustrated by Gail Garraty; Bantam Books, 14th edition,
  JanuaryÂ 1981.  I finished the Sci Fi channels *Legends of Earthsea*
  mini series; it was very, very bad. Thankfully the original books
  remain classics.

+ *Crown Duel*, by Sherwood Smith; Firebird/Penguin Putnam Inc, 2002.
  Originally published as *Crown Duel* and *Court Duel* by Harcourt,
  Brace, & Co in 1997 and 1998.  A very good fantasy of manners; the two
  books really are better as one.
