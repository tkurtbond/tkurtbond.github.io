+ *Masters of Fantasy*, edited by Bill Fawcett and Brian Tomsen; Baen,
  2004.  I think this book is misnamed: I think it includes works by
  only two “Masters” (Norton and Foster, though each are more masters
  of space opera in the non-pejorative sense, especially Foster) and
  several who are potentially “Masters”, along with a lot of extruded
  fantasy product.  In practical terms, I only *liked* the stories by
  Norton, Asprin & Nye, Drake, Moon, and Weber. Several of the others
  were competently written, and the rest were extruded fantasy
  product. (Foster is definitely a “Master” of space opera, and I've
  liked his *Spellslinger* tales in the past, but this one did nothing
  for me.)

  In the Introduction Thomsen talks about the difference
  between “category” fiction (he explicitly calls “category” a
  pejorative) and “genre” fiction. As far as I can tell, the
  difference is that “category” fiction's main venues for sales were
  the drug store and gas station (and probably, though he doesn't say
  this, the supermarket) wire racks and the fact that they sold
  relatively few copies, while “genre” fiction sold well and was
  respected by the publisher and bookseller and was treated as
  essentially a normal fiction book. Thomsen attributes the publishers'
  and booksellers' current “respect” for fantasy entirely to
  fantasy's ability to produce best sellers, and to this respect
  attributes the existence of the numerous small publishers specializing
  in the genre.

  Frankly, I disagree. The publishing industry's
  “respect”, as always, is for bestsellers only, because they make
  the most money for the publisher, and they're perfectly happy to
  discard authors who are profitable but not bestellers. That's why
  there has been an increase in small publishers: they are the only ones
  willing to publish these profitable but not bestselling authors. The
  big publishers are more interested in gambling on who will produce the
  next bestseller, so they publish new authors and drop them unless they
  produce bestsellers. That's why the size if a print run for a typical
  fantasy book are smaller now than in the mid 70s: print a few, see if
  it becomes a best seller, and if not, don't print any more, regardless
  of whether it was profitable or not. Go for the pot of gold at the end
  of the bestseller rainbow and ignore the profitable small business
  along the side road.

  + “Introduction”, by Brian Thomsen.
  + “Out of the Deep”, A *Valdemar* story, by Mercedes Lackey.
  + “Earthborne”, A *Witchworld* story, by Andre Norton.
  + “Mything in Dreamland”, A *Myth Adventures in Dreamland* story,
    by Robert Asprin and Jody Lynn Nye.
  + “Race for the Sky”, A *Bifrost* story, by Mickey Zucker
    Reichert.
  + “Shademehr and the Old Wive's Tale”, A *Shadamehr* story, by
    Margaret Weis and Don Perrin.
  + “Serenade”, A *Spellsinger* story, by Alan Dean Foster.
  + “Child of Prophecy”, A *War of Light and Shadow* story, by Janny
    Wurts.
  + “The Afterlife of St. Vidicon of Cathode”, A *Warlock* story, by
    Christopher Stasheff.
  + “The Elf House”, An *Isles* story, by David Drake.
  + “Gifts”, A *World of Paksenarrion* story, by Elizabeth Moon.  Moon
    has come a long way from her original, AD inspired, *Paksenarrion*
    books; this story makes me want to reread the first few to see how
    much of it was always there.
  + “The Amorous Broom”, A *John Justin Mallory* story, by Mike
    Resnick.
  + “Web of Deception”, A *Bahzell* story, by David Weber.  Well, it's
    not *really* a Bahzell story, is it? It is set in the same world, and
    Bahzell appears as an important supporting character. Good all the
    same.

.. _kothar:

+ *Kothar and the Wizard Slayer*, by Gardner F. Fox; Unibook/Modern
  Promotions, 1970.  I picked this up because of Ron Edwards' mention of
  Fox's Sword & Sorcery books in *Sorcerer and Sword*; I might read
  another of Fox's books if I ran across it, but I wouldn't search them
  out.

.. _drinker:

+ *Drinker of Souls*, by Jo Clayton; DAW, 1986; DAW Collectors Book
  No. 668.  Jo Clayton's books always have interesting protagonists in
  hostile surroundings, and always make me appreciate the comparative
  safety of a well-run modern legal system; well worth rereading.
