+ *The Life and Works of Chopin*, by Jeremy Seipman; narrated by
  Jeremy Siepmann with Anton Lesser, Neville Jason, Elaine Claxton, and
  Karen Archer; NAXOS AudioBooks Ltd, copyright 2001.
+ *The Farthest Shore*, by Ursula K. Le Guin, copyright 1972;
  Antheneum, September 1972; Bantam Books, October 1975; 8th printing,
  November 1977.
+ *Tehanu*, by Ursula K. Le Guin. Atheneum, 1990.  Originally
  published as *Tehanu: the last book of Earthsea*.  When *Tehanu* was
  first released there was a lot of controversy amongst those who
  remembered the first three * Earthsea* books fondly because where
  the first three were beloved children's/young adult books about
  (among other things) coming of age and choices, *Tehanu* is about
  (among other things) child abuse and gender/power
  relationships. Many felt that Le Guin had used the popularity of the
  earlier three books as a springboard for a polemic. I recently
  reread the three earlier books and the fourth in fairly close
  proximity, and in my considered opinion the fourth book has the same
  voice as the earlier three: it's definitely an *Earthsea* book.  I
  was glad to find, `a while ago`__, that there *were* more *Earthsea*
  stories to be told after *Tehanu*.
