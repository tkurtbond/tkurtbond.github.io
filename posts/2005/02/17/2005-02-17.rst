+ *The Gate of Ivory*, by Doris Egan; DAW Books, February 1989.
+ *Incubus Dreams*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Berkley Books, September,
  2004.  As has become usual, it seems as if more of the plot is dealing
  with Anita Blake's sex life than anything else. Still good, if you can
  tolerate that level of explicit detail.
