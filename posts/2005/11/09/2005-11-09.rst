What is WFRP ABout, Really?
---------------------------

Nobody says it better than `James Wallis
<http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue8/jameswallisreplies1.html>`__:

    *D&D* is about quests for glory and riches; WFRP pretends to be the
    same, but in fact is about the PCs' day-to-day fight for survival in a
    universe that hates them. If you don't finish each adventure worse off
    than when you started it, your GM is doing something wrong.

`WJW <http://www.thuntek.net/~walter/>`__ says it `well
<http://www.thuntek.net/~walter/inter.htm>`__:

    I devoured a whole lot of Wodehouse in my teens, in those formative
    years when I was devouring a lot of Delany and Zelazny and Robert
    Heinlein. I eventually gave up on Wodehouse because I realized that
    all the Jeeves stories had the same plot. I've come back to them since
    becoming a full-time writer because I've realized exactly how hard it
    is to write 90 books with exactly the same plot, and it is not a skill
    to be sneezed at.
