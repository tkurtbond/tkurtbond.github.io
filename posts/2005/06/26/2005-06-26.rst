Recent Viewing
--------------

+ *Blade Runner*, 1992. Directed by Ridley Scott, based on a novel by
  Philip K. Dick, written by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples.
  Director's Cut.  It's always good to See *Blade Runner*, even if you
  miss the first 5 minutes.

+ *Land of Unreason*, by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt;
  copyright 1942 by Henry Holt and Company, Inc., renewed 1969 by L.
  Sprague de Camp; Baen, first Baen printing January 1987.  A light and
  entertaining romp in fairyland. I wish more modern fantasy were
  influenced by this sort of book.
