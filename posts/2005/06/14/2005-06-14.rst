+ *The Road of Kings*, by Karl Edward Wagner; copyright 1979 by Conan
  Properties, Inc.; Bantam Books, October 1979.  This is the only one of
  the *Conan* pastiches that I've read that I've really liked. Wagner is
  not Howard, but he was a fine writer himself, and his vision of Conan
  does not seem to contradict Howard's.  I wish both Wagner and Howard
  could have lived longer.
