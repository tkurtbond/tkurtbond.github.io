Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Jackie Brown <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/>`__, 1997.
  Directed by Quentin Tarantino, written by Quentin Tarantino, based on
  the novel *Rum Punch* by Elmore Leonard.  I like some of Quentin
  Tarantino's films, but not all. This was one of them that didn't
  really work for me.

Recent Reading
--------------

+ *The Pastel City*, by M. John Harrison, copyright 1971; Avon Books,
  First Avon Printing July 1974; Second Printing.  A very good post-
  historical collapsing civilization fantasy, quirky and intriguing. I
  wish more modern fantasy was inspired by this: we'd have much less
  extruded fantasy product if it was.
