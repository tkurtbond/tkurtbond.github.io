Recent Viewing
--------------

+ *Mighty Joe Young*, 1949. Directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack, writing
  by Merian C. Cooper and Ruth Rose, special effects by Ray Harryhausen
  and others.  I scanned this quickly. Entertaining, as movies from that
  era go, and the stop-motion animation is good, as one would expect.
