+ `Song of the Thin Man <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039853/>`__,
  1947. Directed by Edward Buzzell, writing by Stanley Robers, Steve
  Fisher, Nat Perrin, James O'Hanlon, Harry Crane, using characters
  created by Dashiell Hammett.  I haven't seen many movies from this era
  that I like, but the *Thin Man* movies are light and entertaining, if
  in no way the equal of Dashiell Hammett's original novel.
