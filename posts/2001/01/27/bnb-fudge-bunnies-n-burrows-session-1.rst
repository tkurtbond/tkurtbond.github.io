   *GURPS Bunnies & Burrows*, “The Herbmaster's Plea”, p. 94.

Attending
=========

I'm guessing at who attended (although I know B.B. was definitely
there) based on player names printed on the character sheets, but they
may or may not have played in this session.  I think they did, because
I wrote something “They did manage to gather *some* vegetables as they
fled.” in my original notes.

+ T.K.B. — GM
+ B.B. — Chamomile, a bunny
+ C.B. — Nimble, a bunny
+ P.B. — 

Actual Play
===========

I ran the first example adventure from *GURPS Bunnies & Burrows*, “The
Herbmaster's Plea”, p. 94, for my nephew B.B. using
Fudge_. [#bunnies-sos]_ He successfully rescued Rosin.  Ended up in
the Orchard on the way to the bean field, after a run-in with the
thugs.  They did manage to gather *some* vegetables as they fled.  It
looks like I named the captain of the Owsla Bayberry.

I think this was the first time I ran a roleplaying game for one of
the kids_.  I ran at least four Fudge_ Bunnies & Burrows for B.B. and
various of the kids_ and their parents.

.. Note:: This is a timewarp_ entry.

   *GURPS Bunnies & Burrows* uses_ for playing *Bunnies & Burrows*
   since creating *Fudge*.
