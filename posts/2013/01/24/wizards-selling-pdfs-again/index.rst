Iâ€™m glad that Wizards of the Coast is selling PDFs__ of their old D&D
products again.  The fact that they've made it possible for folks who
bought their previous PDFs from rpgnow.com/drivethrurpg.com to
redownload  them (and apparently in some cases at least, new, improved
versions of the PDFs) is a major plus to me.  And having Shannon
Appelcline write historical notes on many of the products is a great plus.
