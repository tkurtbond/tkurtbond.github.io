Blackmailed into joining a military organization.

Whispering rock — pure Visitanium, dark blue, gift to museum.

Museum curator tried to escape with rock and Alex shot him in the head.

Next room 4 automatons drop out of ceiling.  We shoot them dead.  We find power cores. 

Giant mole rat, dead.  Another giant mole rat, it eventually retreats.
