Actual Play
===========

The PCs rescued Virginia Cotton from rowdy pirates.  (+1 Fame) They
escorted her to the Royal Crown Tavern.  Her contact, Knox (???), told
her that her dad Jebidiah was a pirate, to her shock, and that he'd
buried a pirate treasure then got captured, and is being held captive
at the house of Baron Pettigrew.  When Virginia tells him that she
knows nothing of the treasure, he grabs her and tells his two thugs to
attack.  We manage to down Knox and one of the thugs and the other
flees.  We take their weapons and leave.

We decide to sneak into Pettigrew's mansion.  Virginia suggests we
have our ship ready to go, so Capt. Jack gives the orders.  We went to
the mansion after dark and snuck up to the back door.  Sneak into the
kitchen, dining room, through the hall past a maid, and found a
sleeping guard.  We tried to knock the guard out and failed, but
intimidated him and tied him up, got the keys from him, opened the
door and found Jebidiah.  We untied Jebidiah and snuck out with him.  

We agreed to split the treasure and headed off in the ship.  Jack
healed up.  We were trailed by another ship, but managed to give them
the slip.  We arrived at the island, but had to ride out a storm
offshore.  Then we took a longboat ashore, and dug up the treasure.
There were five chests, each containing 500$.  We distributed the
treasure, one chest each to Jebidiah, Virginia, our crew, Rowena, and
Capt. Jack.

Aftermath
=========

+5 XP.
