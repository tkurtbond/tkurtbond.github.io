Actual Play
===========

We played the last session of M.A.H.'s “Footsteps of the Fallen”
campaign, and were successful in eliminating the Mourning!  In mass
battle we defeated the army of the Lord of the Blades.  Afterward we
killed the Lord of the Blades, but the psychic purple creature who
turned out to be behind it all escaped.  We're left with a bunch of
psychically active purple glass that can be mined and turned into
psychically active artifacts.

This was probably the 33rd game session we'd played, and we'd been
playing since the first session on 2013-02-27.  

Aftermath
=========

We got +5500 XP.
