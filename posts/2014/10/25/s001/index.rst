Actual Play
===========

Got to the sunken city of Pazar.  Dru fell in.  Everybody followed
down after tying rope around stone. Jeffrey was first onto the
platform.  Killed all the tarantulas in :area:`G2`.  Opened the way to
:area:`G7`, but didn't open the lamp.  Left.  

Eventually see Amun Re.  He points them to the pyramid.  Left off
playing right outside the temple.
