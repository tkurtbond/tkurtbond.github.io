   We're playing the module `Shadowbrook Manor`, so if you haven't
   played that you might want to skip this entry.

Actual Play
===========

We had returned to town and Gustavio had cast detect magic: +1
Quarterstaff, 7 magic bullets, 2 magic longswords.

Kitchen â€” Karl opens cookie jar and is apparently possessed by
something.  Gustav sleeps him and we tie him up.  Travel to a large
city, Orm finds a cleric of Thor of relatively high level who
dispossesses Karl and gives us the shattered remains of the cookie
jar.  Karl is restored.

Back to the manor.  Orm finds a long sword in the attic, Karl picks it
up.  Orm finds brass knuckles.  Skeggi found a skullcap.  Nothing
interesting on the widow's walk.

Take book to library, get 1000 gp = 125 gp each.
