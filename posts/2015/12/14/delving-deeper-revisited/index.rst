I ran across the current edition of `Delving Deeper`__ on the web a
few weeks ago, and it prompted me to reread it in some depth.  (It had
been some time since I read my copy of the Delving Deeper `box
set`__.)  The current version of the Delving Deeper Reference Rules
(V4) is available online__ in hypertext or for free download as three
digest-sized booklets.

I've decided I like this rule set very much.  It really seems to
reflect the rules of the original 3 Little Brown Books of Original D&D
very well, and I can see that there are enough differences from, say,
the Labyrinth Lord rules that I have been using, to make it a
different experience.  I'm looking forward to trying it out.

It prompted me to sit down and draw out a dungeon level and fill it
using the method in `Delving Deeper`, which turned out to be good fun.
