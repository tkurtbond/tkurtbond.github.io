Today I got notices from `Ulisses Spiele`_ via DriveThruRPG_ that
each of the Heliograph_ `Space 1889`_ PDFs had been updated, saying:

    “An updated PDF with bookmarks and meta information is now available.”

.. _`Space 1889`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space:_1889

I'm a little surprised to see this at this late date — is there that
much demand for these PDFs?  Still, I'm pleased to get the updates,
and glad there's still interest.  I've never tried the Ubiquity_ based
version, though I‘ve been thinking about buying the `Savage Worlds`_
versions of those adventures, but the original system has charms of
its own.
