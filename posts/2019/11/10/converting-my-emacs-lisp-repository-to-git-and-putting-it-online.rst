I've had a mercurial_ repository for my Emacs Lisp initialization
files since Thursday, Oct 29, 2009, but had actually used it very
little.  Recently I had occasion to untangle my initialization files
somewhat â€” they had over 12,000 lines of code when I started, and I've
reduced that to 6,137 lines and switched over to using Elpa_ packages
for as much stuff as I can.

I decided I'd put it in one of the online repositories, and since I'm
already using `github.com`_ for my blog I decided to put it there_.
But that meant converting it to GIT_.  I used the directions here_
using fast-export_ which seemed to work fine.
