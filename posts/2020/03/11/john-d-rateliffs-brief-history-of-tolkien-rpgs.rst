The Internet provides: `John D. Rateliff's`_ “Brief History of Tolkien
RPGS” (Video_, Commentary_ on the video, and the essay in four parts:
`Part 1`_, `Part 2`_, `Part 3`_, `Part 4`_), linked here for
reference.

Part 1 ends with:

    Given the uncertain state of the Tolkien copyrights in the 1970s
    (which is another story I can come back to later it you like),
    it's almost certain that it was NOT the Tolkien Estate, but rather
    Zaentz's Tolkien Enterprises, that sent TSR their cease & desist
    back sometime in late 1977. Whereupon Gygax and Company at once
    filed the serial numbers off, except in a few odd cases such as
    "orc" (which they ludicrously began to claim came not from Tolkien
    but from an Irish word for pig, leading to the silly-looking
    pig-snouted orcs of the Monster Manual [page 76]) and 'mithral'
    (which they simply decided to misspell) and otherwise went on
    their merry way.

    
I'd never heard of this origin for pig-faced orcs!
