There is a very interesting six-part series of articles (I_, II_,
III_, IV_, V_, VI_) at `A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry`_ that
analyzes the Siege of Gondor in the Peter Jackson film and in the
Tolkien book, including logistics, operations, cavalry mechanics, the
physics of supernatural creatures and their weapons, and .  As is not
surprising, the sequence in the Peter Jackson film makes compromises
with the story to better suit film, while the sequence in the book is
better grounded in the reality of historical battles.

There is also a review of the Gondor Heavy Infantry Kit_, which
depends on the discussion of armor in the Lannister_ Infantry Kit
review.
