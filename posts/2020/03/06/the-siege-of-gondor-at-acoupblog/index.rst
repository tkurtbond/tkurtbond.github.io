There is a very interesting six-part series of articles (I_, II_,
III_, IV_, V_, VI_) at `A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry`_ that
analyzes the Siege of Gondor in the Peter Jackson film and in the
Tolkien book, including logistics, operations, and cavalry mechanics.
As is not surprising, the sequence in the Peter Jackson film makes
compromises with the story to better suit film, while the sequence in
the book is better grounded in the reality of historical battles.
