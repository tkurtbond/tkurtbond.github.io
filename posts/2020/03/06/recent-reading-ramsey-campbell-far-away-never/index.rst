After reading `Flame and Crimson`_ I went and bought several of the
Sword & Sorcery books it discussed.  Here is the first one I finished:

* `Far Away & Never`_, by Ramsay Campbell, copyright 1996,
  Necronomicon Press, ISBN-10: 0940884860.

  Enjoyable collection of stories, avoiding the flaws of many of
  the later sword & sorcery authors.

  The word-based magic in “The Stages of the God” and “The Song at the
  Hub of the Garden” had a flavor of its own, and “The Ways of Chaos”
  made me want to read `Ghor, Kin-Slayer: The Saga of Genseric's
  Fifth-Born Son` (1_, 2_).
