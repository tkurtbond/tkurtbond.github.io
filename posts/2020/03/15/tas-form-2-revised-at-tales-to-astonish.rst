The Tales to Astonish blog has an article_ with a revised version of
TAS Form 2, the character sheet for Traveller.  The article
includes a direct link to a fairly large JPG (in height and width, not
data size) that thus can be printed. [#seann]_ It has places for each weapon to
write the modifiers for each type of armor, each range, the required
attribute and the Dice Modifier (DM) for if you are under the required
level, the advantageous attribute and the DM for if you meet or are
over the advantageous level, where it delivers a blow, a swing, or a
shot, the weakened blow or swing DM, and the hits of damage a
successful blow does.  Having this information for each weapon on the
character sheet so you don't have to look it up each combat is very
useful.

.. [#seann] He links to a blog post_ that seems to be the original
   source of that character sheet, which is on a blog only open to
   invited readers now, but the Internet Archive has the blog page
   saved_, and on it there is a link_ to the PDF.  The Internet
   Archive didn't have the PDF saved, but the original link itself
   still worked.  I also added it_ to the Internet Archive, so
   hopefully it is saved forever.
