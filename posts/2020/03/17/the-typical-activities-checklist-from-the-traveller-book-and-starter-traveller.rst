I've been looking at Cepheus Engine and I've noticed that there is
nothing like the “Typical Activities” checklist that first appeared in
`The Traveller Book`, but which I first encountered in play recently
with `Starter Traveller`.  It made a definite impression on me — with
this one could improvise a trading session from start to end.  I'm not
sure yet whether Cepheus Engine supports the completely improvised
Traveller adventure `talked about`_ on the `Tales to Astound`_ blog,
but using this with Cepheus Engine would certainly make it easier.
