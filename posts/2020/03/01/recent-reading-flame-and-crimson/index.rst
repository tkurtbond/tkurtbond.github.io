* `Flame and Crimson: A History of Sword-and-Sorcery`__, by Brian
  Murphy, copyright 2019, ISBNÂ 978-1-68390-244-7.

  __ https://www.amazon.com/Flame-Crimson-History-Sword-Sorcery/dp/1683902440/

  A very good survey of Sword and Sorcery fiction, well worth reading.
  I'm going to have to read it again and pull out all the books and
  authors it mentions.

  I found it much more interesting and useful and indeed inspiring
  than I found `Appendix N`_, Jeffro Johnson's survey of the sword and
  sorcery literature from the `AD&D Dungeon Masters Guide`__.  Both
  cover a lot of the same works, but I found Jeffro's book somewhat
  unfocused and in a few occasions a little mean spirited, but worth
  reading for someone interested in D&D.
