* `Under the Green Star`, by Lin Carter, copyright 1972; DAW Books No. 30.

  This is a slight volume, with only 144 pages long, and is a member
  of the `Sword & Planet`_ genre.  It is an enjoyable action tale,
  obviously influenced by `Edgar Rice Burroughs`_\ 's `John Carter of
  Mars`_ stories.  While perhaps not the equal of the John Carter of
  Mars stories, it has attractions of its own.

While reading `Flame & Crimson`_ I was reminded of many `Sword &
Sorcery`_ authors, and was introduced to many new ones.  I decided
that I needed to reread and read anew these authors.  Along the way I
broadened my ambit to include Sword & Planet authors, and have begun
with this Lin Carter volume.
