Dale E. Rippke over at the `The Darkstorm Files`_ has a wonderful
timeline, `Lord of Chaos`_, of Kane's adventures.

He also has two interesting articles on the planned but unfinished
Kane novels, `Reflections of a Midnight Sun`_ and `Phantasmal Tomes`_,
and another interesting article on the Kane/Elric crossover,
`Rethinking The Gothic Touch`_, and a world gazetteer of Kane, `The Age of
Shattered Empires`_.

There is a map_ of Kane's world (pinterest tells me that site is
banned because it “leads to spam”) which I gather was drawn after
Dale E. Rippke's original, which I can find no trace of on the
Internet.

And I stumbled over `From The Sorcerer's Skull`\ ‘s post `Gaming
Kane`_ which gives some information about Kane in `Dragon Magazine`
#26 (June 1979) as a D&D character.
