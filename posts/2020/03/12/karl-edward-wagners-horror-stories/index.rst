I primarily know `Karl Edward Wagner`_\ 's work from his “heroic
fantasy” [#hf]_ novels and stories of Kane_ which I picked up in
paperback in the mid 1980s, but he was equally talented as a writer
and editor of horror.  I *have* read his British Fantasy Award-winning
story “Sticks” and it had a considerable effect on me, but I don't
remember every reading any of his other horror stories.  The ISFDB_
has what seems a very complete page_ listing his writings.

I aim to fix that.  I've now got copies of the `Centipede Press`_
collections `Where the Summer Ends`_ (2012) and `Walk on the Wild
Side`_ (2012) and I'll be reading them soon.

.. [#hf]  A term he vastly preferred to “Sword & Sorcery”.
