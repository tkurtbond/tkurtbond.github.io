From an article originally from `Space Gamer` #76, republished on
Medium_ for the 35th Anniversary of Man to Man, the GURPS combat
system:

    What am I trying to accomplish with MTM and GURPS? In a nutshell,
    I’m trying to establish a game system simple enough for beginners,
    detailed enough for experts, flexible enough for everybody — and
    infinitely variable to fit the infinite worlds of fact and
    fiction. I’m hoping to establish a new tournament standard.

    And so far, I’m happy with it. Pick it up, and let me know what
    you think.

Yeah, I think he pretty much nailed it.
