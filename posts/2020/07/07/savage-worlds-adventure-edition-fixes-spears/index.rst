One of the things that I like about `Savage Worlds Adventure
Edition`__ (SWADE) is that it fixed spears so that you can use them
one-handed, but only get bonus to parry if you use both hands.  In
`Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition` (SWD) and earlier editions spears could
only be used two-handed.

=========  ======  ===========  ====================================
Edition    Type    Damage       Notes
=========  ======  ===========  ====================================
SWD        Spear   Str+d6       Parry +1, Reach 1, 2 hands
SWADE      Spear   Str+d6       Reach 1. Parry +1 if used two-handed
=========  ======  ===========  ====================================

This allows the historical “Spear and Shield” combat style.
See Lindybeige_ for why this matters.

Maybe something similar should have been done with Staff as well,
changing it so it can be used one-handed but losing the “Parry +1” in
that case.  Maybe not, since a staff depends on strength for more of
its damage than the mostly piercing spear.
