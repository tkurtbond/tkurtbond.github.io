- `Auran Empire Primer`__ for the `Adventurer, Conqueror, King
  System`__ (ACKS) published by `Autarch LLC`__, ©2016.

This short (23 page counting covers) introduction to the Auran Empire
and the areas around it includes:
  
- 1 page cover.

- 1 page title page.

- 1 page credits page.

- An 1 page overview with short sections on purpose, culture,
  religion, cosmology, monsters, magic, and ancient artifacts.

- A 1⅓ page description of the various lands of the area under discussion
  (which includes the lands surrounding the Auran Empire).

- A ⅔ page timeline covering over 4000 years.

- A 2 page map of the area.

- A ⅔ page legend of map symbols.

- A 3⅔ page section on Customs, covering Laws and Governance, Coins and
  Money, Fashion and Dress, Slavery and Indenture [#not-race-based]_,
  Travel and Vehicles, Engineering and Construction, Knowledge and
  Learning, Weapons and Warfare, Religion and Myth, Clergy and
  Churches, and a table of Gods and Goddesses listing their names,
  titles, spheres of influence, holy symbols, sacred animals.

- An 8 page section on People, giving basic descriptions of the
  various nationalities and/or ethnicities: Celdorean, Dwarven, Elven
  (Argollëan), Jutlandic, Kemeshi, Krysean, Kushtu, Nicean, Opelenean,
  Rornish, Shebatean, Somirean, Skysos, Thrassian, Tirenean, and
  Zaharan.

- A 1½ page table of languages, with their real-world
  inspiration.

- Finally, a 1 page back cover.

I thought this was a very good overview of a campaign setting.

I wish that the map had shown less of the north of the map where the
barbarians lived and more of the south, where there are several
countries described that are not on the map.

I liked that the nationality/ethnicity entries included descriptions
of the typical appearance, including skin color, hair color, body
shape, average height, face shape, and so forth, and that there is a
fair variety of each.

I liked that the culture section gives the real-world cultures that
inspired the game world cultures.  For example, “The dominant Imperial
culture [of the Auran Empire] is closely akin to the Late Roman Empire
and Early Byzantine Empire.”

.. [#not-race-based] As far as I can tell, slavery is not based on
   race — anybody can end up a slave, except in the Auran Empire
   itself where slavery is illegal.  The Auran Empire, however, has
   indentured servitude, which the other nations regard as the same
   thing as as slavery.
