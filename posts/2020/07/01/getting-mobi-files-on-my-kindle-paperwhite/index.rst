I created a .epub file using pandoc_.  Then I converted the .epub to
.mobi via the `Calibre epub software`__.  Then I tried copying the
.mobi to the Documents folder on the Kindle via USB (which several
places online say is the way to do it) but that didn’t show up when I
looked (and searched) my library.

So I had to mail it to my Kindle.

- Go on Amazon,
- select “Account & Lists > Your Content and Devices > Preferences tab (at the top of the
  page, under the normal black Amazon menu/search area) > Personal
  Document Settings”.
- Then copy the email from your “Send-To-Kindle
  E-Mail Settings” and create an e-mail to it.  
- Check that the “Approved
  Personal Document E-mail List” contains your e-mail address, or add a
  new one.  
- Then attach the .mobi file to the e-mail and send it.
- After a little while you’ll get a “Verify your Kindle document” from Amazon
  with a link to click to verify it.  Click it.
- After a little while you can go
  back to the “Content” tab and search your content for the title, and
  it should be there.  You can also change the “Show” combo box at the
  top of the page to “Docs” instead of “Books” and it should be listed
  there, too.  

Weeeee!
