I *finally* got my order of `Adventurer, Conqueror, King System`
(ACKS_) books by Autarch_ from DriveThruRPG_ today.  The COVID-19
pandemic has really delayed their POD printing and shipping, so I was
quite some time waiting.

.. _ACKS: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System
.. _Autarch: http://www.autarch.co/
.. _DriveThruRPG: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/

The books I got were:

* `Adventurer Conqueror King System`
* `ACKS Player's Companion`
* `Heroic Fantasy Handbook`
* `Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu`
* `Axioms Compendium 1-8`
* `ACKS Domains at War - Battles`
* `Lairs & Encounters`
* `Capital of the Borderlands (revised edition)`
* `Eyrie of the Dread Eye`
* `Ruined City of Cyfandir`
* `Secrets of the Nethercity`
* `The Sinister Stone of Sakkara`

I had already received_, some weeks ago, one book from that order: 

* `Auran Empire Primer`

I got these because I'm planing on running some ACKS_ adventures,
possibly leading up to the ACKS_ version of Dwimmermount_.  I got a
request from one of my players to try a megadungeon_, and after
looking at the ones I had I decided to try out Dwimmermount_.  I have
both the `Labyrinth Lord`_ and ACKS_ versions (I backed the
kickstarter for Dwimmermount_), but have never played ACKS_ before.  I
thought it would be a good opportunity to try it.  However, I didn't
want to run a new system at the same time as trying to run my first
megadungeon, so I thought I'd get some of the published ACKS_
adventures and run one of them first, to get myself and my players
used to the system.

While waiting for this order to come in I've been rereading the ACKS_
core rulebook, as I already had a copy of that and the `ACKS Player's
Companion`.  I admit that I found reading “Chapter 4: Proficiencies”
and “Chapter 5: Spells” slow going.  The proficiencies are sometimes
like feats and sometimes like skills and have a lot of details that
need to be read carefully.  The spells also have to be read carefully,
to see how they differ from the versions of D&D I've run before.  I
expect that I'll be going much faster now that I'm through those
chapters, though there may be some slogging during “Chapter 8:
Monsters”.

All in all, I'm liking what I'm reading.  I think that the things that
ACKS_ adds give it a lot more depth without increasing its complexity
to `AD&D 1E` or `D&D 3.5E` levels.  I think the players will
appreciate the increased options for their characters and I'll
appreciate the additional support for things like economic background
and domain play.

Since I got my order I've scanned quickly over the books I got.  They
all seem interesting and useful.  I'm now reading `The Sinister Stone
of Sakkara` in parallel with the core rulebook, thinking that it will
be the best introduction to the game for myself as Judge (that's
ACKS_\'s term for Dungeon Master) and my players.  It is a setup
somewhat like “Keep on the Borderland” with a military fort with an
associated village and a stronghold of evil nearby.  By default It is
set on the Auran Empire's Borderlands province, which has some
interesting setting details, but once would easily place it anywhere
in ones own campaign.  One thing about it that has impressed me is the
background information it supplies on workings of the fort “Türos
Tem”, which, without becoming tedious, goes down to the amount of hay
on hand to feed the the horses of the fort's cavalry soldiers and how
long it will last and how much it cost.  Some people would say “who
would need that information?” because they run campaigns that
concentrate on wild adventure and don't sweat the background details,
but I've found in the past that having that detail can inspire ideas
for more wild adventure, and it fits into ACKS_\'s additional support
for domain play and economic underpinnings.

Anyway, I'm really looking forward to playing ACKS_.  Now I just have
to figure out a `Virtual Table Top`__ (VTT) to use.
