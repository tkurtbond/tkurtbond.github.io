I just got my `Worlds of Wonder`__ box set from `Noble Knight`__.  It
was published by Chaosium__ in 1982, and consists of 4 pamphlets —
`Basic Role-Playing`, `Magic World`, `Super World`, and `Future
World`, each under 20 pages — and some supporting game aids.  It was
very interesting to see Chaosium's house system be stripped down so
much in `Basic Role-Playing`, and then built up again slightly in each
of the genre specific pamphlets.  There are some interesting design
decisions there.  I'm not sure that all of those same decisions were
exactly included in the Big Gold Book version of Chaosium's `Basic
Roleplaying`__ book published in 2010, which collected rules from most
of Chaosium's games into one generic roleplaying game.  I'll have to
compare them to see.  I should also compare it to the `BRP
Quickstart`__.  I do have Chaosium's 2002 publication of the
`Basic Roleplaying` pamphlet.  It was better typeset but was otherwise
functionally identical to the pamphlet from `Worlds of Wonder`.

I'd love to see a PDF version of `Worlds of Wonder`, even if it was
just a scanned version.  Even better if it was release as an SRD__,
like their `BRP SRD`__.
