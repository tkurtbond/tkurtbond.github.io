I'm looking at the Mini Six RPG because I’m planing on running a
couple of one shots while our regular D&D game is on hiatus
between campaigns.  I’m going to run a Star Wars one shot and a
`Breachworld RPG`_ (post apocalypse with rifts into space and time
with invaders pouring through) one shot, probably using the light
Virtual Table Top `Owlbear Rodeo`__ with Discord__ for voice and text
chat and dice rolling using a dice bot and maybe image sharing, with
character sheets as Google Doc documents.

It really packs a lot into a small package, although it is generally
light on detail.
    
Thoughts on `Mini Six`
======================

`Mini Six` is a stripped down version of the OpenD6_ RPG.
I like it for many reasons:

.. _OpenD6: http://opend6project.org/

• The base mechanics are easy to learn, and only take up a few pages.
• Only D6s are used.\ [#simpledice]_
• Characters are easy to create.
• Characters are relatively terse.\ [#havan]_
• Characters start out reasonably competent.
• It has a metacurrency\ [#metacurrency]_, Hero Points.
• It includes enough as is to run Historical, Modern, Sci-Fi, and
  Fantasy games, including a simple Magic/Power system.
• Attributes, Skills, and Damage are rated by the number of D6s one
  rolls to use them, which makes using them easy.
• Attributes and Skills are connected.  Skills default to the dice
  rating of their associated Attribute, so you can always use a
  skill, except for a very few skills.
• Attributes and Skills are used by rolling them against set target
  numbers or opposing die rolls.
• The rules for multiple actions in a round are particularly easy to
  use, suitable for games where the characters are competent.
• Since the rules are short and the game mechanics relatively light it
  is easy to customize.
• It can be easily customized for a particular game or genre.
• Since the rules (but not the settings) are Open Content you can
  easily base a new game on it and release it for free or sell it.
  There are several `Mini Six`-based games on DriveThruRPG.com.\
  [#games]_
• There is a royalty-free `Mini Six Trademark License`__ that allows you to
  indicate that products you make are compatible with `Mini Six`.\ [#adventures]_

I think that several of those reason make it idea for one shots and
pickup games.

-----

.. [#simpledice] This is especially useful if some of your players
   haven't ever played RPGs before and are unfamiliar with polyhedral
   dice.

.. [#havan] Here's an example character:

   **Havan Zul — Smuggler**

   | **Might 3D** — Brawling 4D
   | **Agility 3D+2** — Dodge 5D+1, Piloting 5D+2, Pistol 5D+2, Stealth 4D+2
   | **Wit 3D+1** — Navigation 5D, Repair 4D, Gunnery 5D+1, Shields 3D+2
   | **Charm 2D** — Streetwise 3D
   | **Static:** Dodge 12, Block 12, Parry 14, Soak 9+6=15
   | **Complications:** Large debt (=ship)
   | **Gear:** tool kit, flight suit (+2), 2 blaster pistols (5D), macro binoculars, body armor (+6)
   | **Hero Points:** 1
   | **WL:** S:1–3 □ W:4–8 □ SW:4–8 □ I:9–12 □ MW:13–16 □

.. [#metacurrency]  I use metacurrency to mean something like
   a renewable resource that a player can spend to do something they
   otherwise couldn't do, like reroll something or convert a damage
   strike into a flesh wound or buying a clue or increase a die roll
   before or after the fact.  Other examples are Bennies in `Savage
   Worlds`_ or Inspiration in `D&D 5E`_.

   .. _Savage Worlds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds#Task_resolution
   .. _D&D 5E: https://dnd5e.info/beyond-1st-level/inspiration/

.. [#games] Some published games based on `Mini Six` are:

   • † `Exilium Core Rules`__ (a game of science fiction adventure and
     intrigue set against a backdrop of post-human loss and
     redemption; the description at DriveThruRPG says it is based on
     OpenD6, which is true, but the credit page of the book
     specifically mentions `Mini Six`),
   • † `Summerland Second Edition`__ (a game about desolation and
     redemption in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by a vast
     supernatural forest),
   • † `Breachworld RPG`_ (a global catastrophe made rips in space and
     time through which unwanted monsters, aliens, and otherworldly
     environments continue to pour),
   • † `Heaven's Shadow`__ (a game of faith and assassination of the
     evil Nephilim in the service of God, set in the modern world),
   • `The Mighty Six`__ (superheros),
   • `Twilight Fall`__ (a post apocalypse world created by the arrival
     on Earth of billions of alien refuges from space and other
     dimensions), and
   • `Mutagen RPG (Beta/Playtest)`__ (MiraiCorp's Project Mutagen
     unleashes mutant uplifted animals on the world who escaped their
     abused lives as test subjects and who want to be left alone, or
     help other mutants or the persecuted, or take the flight to
     MiraiCorp).

   † marks games I find particularly interesting, either for the
   setting or for how a game adapts `Mini Six`.‡
