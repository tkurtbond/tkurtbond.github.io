I once quoted Ken Hite's description of D&D

    The original D&D seems, quite obviously, to be a pastiche of Fritz
    Leiber and Robert E. Howard adventure stories, set in a Tolkeinian
    world of Moorcockian morality, using Jack Vance's magic system,
    redacted for multiple protagonists. No wonder things are confused.

to a friend, and they were a little offended, considering it a
criticism of D&D.  I guess it *is* a criticism, but I think it is a
valid description of D&D.  However, I advance the theory that this
“confused” nature of D&D is what makes it successful, because it
provides so many different (and sometimes conflicting) elements that
you can come up with about anything in D&D, and it will be fun.  Each
gaming group selects those things from D&D that they find interesting,
customizing their play to their taste.  This is something that is
sometimes much harder in more focused games.

What do you think?
