* `Cthulhu: The Mythos and Kindred Horrors`, by Robert E. Howard,
  copyright 1987 by Ala Key Kuykendall and Alla Ray Morris; Baen
  Publishing Enterprises; ISBN 0-671-65641-4.

I enjoyed reading these again; it has been many years since I have
read them.  The racism of the stories set in America is what you'd
expect from a person of Howard's era, but the other elements of the
stories make the book worth reading.

* `By the Light of the Green Star`, by Lin Carter, copyright 1974; DAW
  Books Number 110.

* `As the Green Star Rises`, by Lin Carter, copyright 1975; DAW Books;
  ISBN 0-87997-811-2. 

* `In the Green Star's Glow`, by Lin Carter, copyright 1976; DAW
  Books.

It is interesting to note that these were popular enough at the time
to go into multiple printings, judging from my copies, all of which
are later printings except for the second book, `When the Green Star
Calls`. The Amazon_ reviews of the books in the series are positive as
well.

They are definitely fast, fun, pulpy adventures.
