After I played `D&D` for a while at the beginning of my RPG career I
found out that I was interested in other games.  `T&T`, then
`DragonQuest`, `RuneQuest`, `GURPS`, and `Elric!` and many more since
then.  Eventually one of the things I figured out was that I was
looking for the different flavors that different RPG systems give the
games you play with them.  `D&D` has a very specific flavor.  `Elric!`
has a very specific but different flavor.  Some of that flavor comes
from the systems and some of that flavor comes from the setting.  But
the `D&D` systems flavor seems to overpower the setting flavor.  (You
could say that the “implied setting elements” from the `D&D` core
rules have heavily flavor any `D&D` setting.)

The `Dungeon Fantasy RPG` is `GURPS` specialized for powerful
characters plundering dungeons, and because of that it adopts some
(but not all) of the cliches from `D&D` (druids, monks, clerics, etc),
and puts its own spin on them.  But one of the things I liked about
`GURPS` was that it *didn't* have the same set of cliches as `D&D`.
Oh well.

Despite looking for the different flavors that systems imbue, I still
like generic RPGs like `GURPS` and `Savage Worlds` and `Basic
Roleplaying`.  I like the flavor that those systems give, and I like
seeing how that interacts with the flavor of the setting.
