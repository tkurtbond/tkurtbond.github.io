`GURPS` (G1_, G2_) from `Steve Jackson Games`__ is a **Generic Universal
RolePlaying System**. The meaning of the separate words, paraphrased
from the introductions of the `GURPS`, 3rd Edition, and `GURPS` 4th
Edition, breaks down the meaning as follows:

.. _G1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS
.. _G2: http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/

* **Generic** — Scaling from quick, fast-moving games with simple
  rules to games with lots of detail.
* **Universal** — a set of rules that's comprehensive enough to let
  you use with any background/setting and potentially to combine characters
  from different backgrounds/settings and have them be compatible.
* **RolePlaying** — designed to encourage true roleplaying
* **System** — designed as a unified whole rather than starting out as
  a set of simple rules and modified in an ad-hoc manner.

The Wikipedia article `Generic role-playing game system`__\'s idea of
a generic RPG_ seems to combine the `GURPS` notions of “Generic” and
“Universal”.  Or maybe it means by “Generic” what `GURPS` means by
“Universal”.
