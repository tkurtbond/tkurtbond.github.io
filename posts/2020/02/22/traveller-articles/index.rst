There is an interesting article_ (or at the `Internet Archive`_) on
Traveller_, linked here for later reference.

Christopher Kubasik's `Traveller Out of the Box`_ series and the
rpg.net thread (R1_) that talks about it, and the `Citizens of the
Imperium` thread or three (C1_, C2_, C3_), and a Classic Traveller thread
(P1_).

And there is Robert Conley's `Classic Traveller Character Generator`_.

And another article at Tor.com_.

And the `Traveller Section by Section Comparison`__.
