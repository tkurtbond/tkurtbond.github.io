I ran across an interesting article: `D&D Next: "Zones of Control"
from Chainmail to 4e`__ which argues, I think with good evidence, that
every version of `D&D` has been based in miniatures as its default
mode of play.  (Alas the original site of this article, `Advanced
Dungeons & Parenting`__ appears to having fallen to some annoying
entropy creating demons.  Some poking about seems to show the original
author being Christian Lindke of Geekerati__.)

The split between abstract combat and miniatures combat was well
established by the time I started with `D&D`, reading the Holmes__
[#holmes]_ edition and then playing first edition `AD&D`__.  We never
played with miniatures.  Indeed, I think the hex grid and miniatures
based tactical combat rules were one of the things that drew me to
`DragonQuest`__ and later `GURPS`__.

.. [#holmes]  I'm irritated that `Wizards of the Coast`__ has not yet
              added the Holmes__ edition, the 1977 blue box Basic Set,
              to the `DM's Guild`__.
