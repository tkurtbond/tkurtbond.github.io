In the article `A role-playing game player’s obligation`__ David
Hartlage of `DM David`__ says:

    As a player, your first role-playing obligation is to imagine a
    character who can cooperate with rest of the party to achieve the
    common goals of the game.

He also quotes Gary Gygax:

    “Always seek to contribute the most to the team’s success. From
    the players’ and the PCs’ standpoint any role-playing game is a
    group endeavor. Individual success is secondary to the success of
    the group, for only through group achievements can the quality of
    the campaign be measured.” – Gary Gygax, Role-Playing Mastery

I think that in general this is a good idea.

Of course, if you are specifically intending to run a game to explore
infighting or where the player characters explicitly have goals that
seriously in conflict, I think that you should make this clear at the
beginning and make sure that everyone is on board.  Moreover, it may
make sense to use an RPG that is specifically designed for that, like
Fiasco_ or `The Mountain Witch`_ rather than introduce those elements
into a traditional RPG.  Even in a game built for that, make sure
everybody is on the same page.  It turns out badly if one person in
the group playing Paranoia_ is playing in **Zap** mode where
troubleshooters open fire on each other with little to no provocation
and another person in is playing in **Straight** mode which
discourages random firefights and horseplay.
