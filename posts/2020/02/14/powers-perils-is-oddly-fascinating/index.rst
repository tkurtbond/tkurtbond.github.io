I bought `Powers & Perils`__ when it first came out.  While I was
never able to complete building a character, I did have fun reading
the rules and the setting details.  It was oddly fascinating.  So
complicated.  Every so often, I circle back to look at it again,
usually starting at the `Powers & Perils`__ website.

What I noticed this time is that a second edition is available on the
rules__ page, which includes both a PDF of the complete rules and a
PDF of the `Perilous Lands` setting information.

The rules are extensively hyperlinked, both in the table of contents
and in cross-references, which should make using such a complicated
system easier.

Right now I can't imaging finding a group that would be interested in
playing `Powers & Perils`, but there is always a lingering impulse to
do something with it.
