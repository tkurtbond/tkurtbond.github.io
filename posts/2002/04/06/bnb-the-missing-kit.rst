This was probably the second RPG session I ran for any of the kids_.
It carries on from the session B.B., and probably C.B. and P.B.,
played.  As before, it uses_ Steffan O'Sullivan's Fudge_ Bunnies
example characters, and the farm from the adventure “The Herbmaster's
Plea”, which starts on page 94 of *GURPS Bunnies & Burrows* and uses
the farm map from page 97.  My notes are *very* sketchy, not even
including who played.

Attending
=========

+ T.K.B. — GM
+ B.B. — a bunny
+ T.A. — maybe; watching us play?

Actual Play
===========

A mother is wailing about her missing kit.

My original notes, transcribed:

   Bunny kit (Buttercup) is missing — last seen on the east side of
   the warren.  Violet is mom.

   Cat in barn — Cleverness: Fair; Self Control: Good; Notice
   Things: Good; Nose: Mediocre; Agility: Superb; Strength: Great;
   Fitness: Good; Speed: Great; Move Quietly: Superb; Combat: Good.

   Cottonmouth by River — Agility: Good; Strength: Great; Fitness:
   Good; Speed: Mediocre.  Poison, then wait for struggle to end.

   Pair of Foxes — Agility: Good, Bite: Great; Strength: Great (+2)

   Track kit to creek, cross  before swamp, cross back at east side of
   duck pond, picked up by human child, kit put in cage in hayloft (loose
   hay), cat above grain box by ladder/steps to loft, cage latched & up
   on wall.

   Followed human tracks (boy picked up the kit) to the barn & are
   about to go in looking for the kit.

Everything down to the next-to-last paragraph is my spur-of-the-moment
setup for the adventure, while the last paragraph is the report of
what actually happened during the session.
