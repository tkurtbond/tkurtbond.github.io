<p>All of the retro-clones and neo-clones mentioned below are games with
which I have some familiarity.  Many of them I've played.  The others
I've read.  All of them have something interesting to recommend them.</p>
<p>There was a time when Wizards of the Coast hadn't made old versions of
D&amp;D available easily, and the retro-clones were very important then.
Even now some retro-clones or neo-clones have better presentation than
the original rules (<a class="reference internal" href="#old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy">Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy</a>) or
present a simpler version of classic rules (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition">Labyrinth Lord: Revised
Edition</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord">Advanced Edition Companion</a> for AD&amp;D), or provide
additional details and further development of a particular D&amp;D version
(<a class="reference internal" href="#adventurer-conqueror-king-system">Adventurer, Conqueror, King System</a>).</p>
<p>And, of course, if you are playing with kids who might not have the
money to buy PDFs of old versions of D&amp;D, many of the retro-clones are
available in PDF or online legally for free.</p>
<section id="what-do-you-want"><h2>What do you want?</h2>
<p>Want a simple, clear, exceptionally well organized and presented
version of the classic <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert D&amp;D</a> (B/X) rules?  See
<a class="reference internal" href="#old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy">Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy</a>.</p>
<p>Want races separate from classes and the most of the extra classes,
races, and many spells from AD&amp;D 1E, all on the 1 to 14 level scale of
the classic <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert D&amp;D</a> (B/X)?  See <a class="reference internal" href="#old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy">Old-School Essentials
Advanced Fantasy</a>.</p>
<p>Want to play classic AD&amp;D 1E modules with all races, classes, and most
spells from AD&amp;D 1E, on a mostly 1 to 20 level scale, with 9<sup>th</sup> level magic user spells and 7<sup>th</sup> cleric spells, but
with simpler mechanics?  See <a class="reference internal" href="#labyrinth-lord-revised-edition-advanced-edition-companion">Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition &amp;
Advanced Edition Companion</a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="#advanced-labyrinth-lord">Advanced Labyrinth Lord</a>.</p>
<p>Want something almost like AD&amp;D 1E?  See <a class="reference internal" href="#osric">OSRIC</a>.</p>
<p>Want something that feels like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(1974)">Original D&amp;D</a>, just what was in the
three original Little Brown Books?  See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/matthew-finch/swords-wizardry-whitebox-rules-softcover/paperback/product-1wzw887q.html?page=1&amp;pageSize=4">Swords &amp; Wizardry Whitebox</a>,

or <a class="reference external" href="https://traversefantasy.itch.io/fmc">Fantastic Medieval Campaigns</a>, especially if you want a
Chainmail-style system for individual and mass combat.  Do you also
want the thief class?  See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/matthew-finch/swords-wizardry-core-rules-softcover/paperback/product-1yvrdzg2.html?">Swords &amp; Wizardry Core</a>.</p>
<p>Want something that feels like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(1974)">Original D&amp;D</a>, just before AD&amp;D 1E
came out, with the races and classes (except for gnomes and
illusionists) and spells familiar from AD&amp;D 1E, but simpler, on a
mostly 1 to 20+ level scale, with up to 9<sup>th</sup> level magic user
spells and 7<sup>th</sup> level cleric spells?  See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/">Swords &amp; Wizardry
Complete</a>.</p>
<p>Like the 1 to 14 level scale and the lower hit dice of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert
D&amp;D</a>, but want more detailed rules, especially magic research,
economics, and domain play (the D&amp;D end game, where the players build
strongholds and rule), with rules for building campaign specific
classes and races, and don't mind some slightly different mechanics?
See the <a class="reference internal" href="#adventurer-conqueror-king-system">Adventurer, Conqueror, King System</a>.</p>
<p>Want the 1 to 36 level scale of Frank Mentzer's <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1983_revision">BECMI</a> rules or Aaron
Allston's <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1991_revision">Rules Cyclopedia</a>?  See <a class="reference internal" href="#dark-dungeons">Dark Dungeons</a>.</p>
</section><section id="basic-fantasy"><h2>Basic Fantasy</h2>
<p>I <em>think</em> I looked at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.basicfantasy.org/">Basic Fantasy</a> first, but it wasn't what I
was looking for at the time.</p>
<p>All its PDFs are free, and the print on demand books are <em>very</em>
inexpensive.</p>
<p>I notice that the character class tables all go to
level 20.  I wonder if this is a residual artifact of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons_3rd_edition">D&amp;D 3E</a>
character classes going to level 20, since it doesn't match the B/X
model that that is implied by the Basic Fantasy website with the
statement “The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game
system modeled on the classic RPG rules of the early 1980's.”
Compare that to Labyrinth Lord's rescaling of B/X to match
AD&amp;D.</p>

<p>While <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition">Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition</a> (LLRE; PDF and POD) has been
criticized for not being a completely faithful retro-clone of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&amp;D rules (B/X), I think it still
holds a useful spot.  The changes that were made in the revised
version of <cite>Labyrinth Lord</cite> made it easier to be used with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord">Advanced
Edition Companion</a> (AEC).  It adapted the 1–14 level scale of B/X to
the scale of AD&amp;D 1E, generally about 20 levels, and with AEC it added
the separate races and the additional classes, spells, monsters, and
magic items of AD&amp;D 1E.</p>
<p>There are versions of LLRE and AEC available for free: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64331/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition-noart-version">No-art LLRE</a> and

</section></section><section id="swords-wizardry"><h2>Swords &amp; Wizardry</h2>
<p><cite>Swords &amp; Wizardry</cite> is inspired by the original D&amp;D booklets and
associated magazine articles.  It comes in various versions, depending
on how much of the supplemental material you want.</p>
<p>I find the original D&amp;D booklets very interesting from a historical
standpoint, but find <cite>Swords &amp; Wizardry</cite> easier to use at the table.</p>
<section id="swords-wizardry-white-box"><h3>Swords &amp; Wizardry White Box</h3>
<p>This is inspired by the original three booklets of D&amp;D, so it includes
only the Fighter, Magic-User, and Cleric, so it strips away everything
but the absolute essentials.</p>
</section><section id="swords-wizardry-core"><h3>Swords &amp; Wizardry Core</h3>
<p>This adds the thief class.</p>
</section><section id="swords-wizardry-complete"><h3>Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete</h3>
<p>If you are looking to play something with the feel of AD&amp;D 1E, but
want something even simpler than <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition">Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord">Advanced Edition Companion</a>, this is an excellent choice, as
long as you don't need half-orcs, gnomes or illusionists.</p>
<p>I like how it discusses different ways to interpret the original
rules, often giving more than option for use with S&amp;WC.</p>
</section></section><section id="old-school-essentials"><h2>Old-School Essentials</h2>
<p><cite>Old-School Essentials</cite> (OSE) is published by <a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/">Necrotic Gnome</a> in two
flavors so far, <cite>Classic Fantasy</cite> and <cite>Advanced Fantasy</cite>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, OSE has improved the clarity, organization, and
presentation of its rules over the already very good <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert
D&amp;D</a> rules.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#although" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> As well as clear wording it uses layout and
typography to enhance its presentation of the rules, from the use of
one and two page spreads that completely cover one subject to the
careful use of bold and bullet points to call out important
information, OSE really shines.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures">adventures</a> that <a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/">Necrotic
Gnome</a> have produced for it (<a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures/products/the-hole-in-the-oak">The Hole in the Oak</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter">Winter's

continue this excellent use of layout, bold, and bullet points to
present their information clearly and without the dreaded “wall of
text” or “read aloud text”.</p>
<aside class="footnote-list brackets"><aside class="footnote brackets" id="although" role="doc-footnote"><span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#footnote-reference-1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Although it has been suggested to me that while OSE excels <em>as a
reference</em>, the original <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert D&amp;D</a> rules have more
explanations of why things work as they do.  I need to reread them
in light of this suggestion.</p>
</aside></aside><section id="old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy"><h3>Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy</h3>
<p><cite>Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy</cite> (<a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-rules-tome">OSECF</a>) is the best organized
and presented version of the classic rules from the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh
Basic/Expert D&amp;D sets.  This is the game that I wish had been around
when I started playing.  There is an SRD (<a class="reference external" href="https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/">OSESRD</a>).  I particularly
like the Classic Fantasy Rules Tome, which collects everything into
one substantial book, but there is also a version split into multiple
books covering separate sections of the rules, so that the magic-user
can look up his spells while the fighter is looking at the combat
rules.</p>
</section><section id="old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy"><h3>Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy</h3>
<p><cite>Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy</cite> is the best organized and
presented version of the ideas of the classic rules from 1<sup>st</sup> edition AD&amp;D, scaled to match the 1–14 level scope of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&amp;D sets.  If I was starting a new
D&amp;D campaign these are the rules I'd use, all things being equal.</p>

</section></section><section id="adventurer-conqueror-king-system"><h2>Adventurer, Conqueror, King System</h2>
<p>The name of this system is usually abbreviated as ACKS.  One of its
explicit design goals for to supply more rules for the end of game of
Original D&amp;D, where the players built strongholds and ruled, hence the
name.  It also has a more detailed economic system.  It is more
complicated than OD&amp;D or B/X, but in a completely different way than
AD&amp;D 1E.</p>
<p>It uses some different mechanics, especially for “to hit” roles, so it
might be considered a <a class="reference external" href="../../../../../pages/rpg-vocabulary/#Neo-clone">Neo-Clone</a>, but it is inspired by B/X D&amp;D, and
keeps to the same 1 to 14 level scale of B/X.  I particularly like its
rules for building your own campaign specific classes from the
<cite>Player's Companion</cite>.</p>
</section><section id="osric"><h2>OSRIC</h2>
<p>I looked at OSRIC (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric/">OSRICKnK</a>), (a free <a class="reference external" href="http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric/download.html">OSRIC PDF</a> is available, as
well as a free PDF of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2411/Usherwood-Publishing">Usherwood Publishing</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/111392/OSRIC-Pocket-SRD-PDF">OSRIC Pocket SRD</a>
version) but was more interested in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision">Basic/Expert D&amp;D</a> retroclones at
the time.  I think it is a well written, organized, and presented
restatement of AD&amp;D 1E.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackBladePublishing/">Black Blade Publishing</a> print edition
is a very nice offset printed volume with a sewn spine.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2411/Usherwood-Publishing">Usherwood
Publishing</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/111392/OSRIC-Pocket-SRD-PDF">OSRIC Pocket SRD</a> (PDF, POD) is quite affordable.  I
just wish OSRIC wasn't missing some of the classes.  (I miss the Monk
in particular.)  I was also surprised by how many of the little quirks
and restrictions of AD&amp;D 1E have been ironed out, although many
remain.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2411/Usherwood-Publishing">Usherwood Publishing</a> has some supplements that add some of
the missing classes, though I'm not sure I like all their versions.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://traversefantasy.itch.io/fmc">Fantastic Medieval Campaigns</a> (FMC) is a retro-clone of the three
Little Brown Books of Original D&amp;D and Chainmail, available for free
in PDF and in print on demand.  I gather it was something the author
did just so they had something easier to follow when playing OD&amp;D with
friends.  I'm glad they made it available.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of clones of OD&amp;D, FMC, as well as including the familiar
d20-based combat system, also includes a clone of the Chainmail rules,
which can be used either for individual combat or mass combat.  FMC is
very well organized, and could be used by someone new to D&amp;D to
play in a group where everybody else is using the OD&amp;D rulebooks, or
as the rules for a whole group.</p>
<p>Basically, FMC is a very well written and organized restatement of
Chainmail and the three LBB.  The layout and design are uncluttered;
the art is charming, the organization is superb, and the writing is
clear.  The physical book is an excellent example of the possibilities
of print-on-demand, with the different sections of the book printed on
different colored backgrounds, making finding specific sections much
easier.  The table of the contents at the front of the book is
reasonably detailed, and each section has its own table of contents as
its first page, opposite the title page for the section.  The book has
a glossary and indexes for monsters, spells, and tables.</p>
<p>In the end this is an exceptional restatement and clarification of the
original game.</p>
