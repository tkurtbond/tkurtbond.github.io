Nothing I'm saying in this post is new; I'm sure other people have
pointed out these or similar things in the past.  I'm just trying to
get my observation down in concrete form.

Someone asked why `Old School
Essentials <https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-old-school-essentials>`__
(OSE) gets so much attention in the OSR world, and why `Swords &
Wizardry <https://www.mythmeregames.com/collections/swords-wizardry>`__
(S&W) doesn’t get more. I like both games very much, and have pledged
for Kickstarters for both systems, but I think that the reason that OSE
gets more attention, especially from from those new to the OSR, is that
OSE provides specific and explicit step by step procedures for running
the game structures that are at the center of the game.

In the article from 6 September 2019, `Game Structures — Addendum:
System
Matters <https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/43568/roleplaying-games/game-structures-addendum-system-matters>`__,
Justin Alexander talks about how the dungeon crawling structure that
originates in Original D&D is completely missing from D&D 5E. (The rest
of his series on `Game
Structures <https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15126/roleplaying-games/game-structures>`__
is also interesting.)

OSE preserves (as you’d expect as a faithful retroclone of the 1981
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert edition of D&D) those procedures and
presents them clearly. Much of the same information is available in
Swords & Wizardry, but the reader has to synthesize most of it from
paragraphs and pages of text, rather than having a step by step
procedure to follow.

Old School Essentials.
======================

Looking at OSE, there are at least 12 procedures, most of which have
explicit lists of steps.  (Page numbers are to the *OSE Classic Fantasy
Rules Tome*.)

†  Indicates step by step procedures.

1.  `Dungeon
    Adventuring† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Dungeon_Adventuring>`__, p. 108.
2.  `Wilderness
    Adventuring† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Wilderness_Adventuring>`__, p. 110.
3.  `Waterbourne
    Adventuring† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Waterborne_Adventuring>`__, p. 112.
4.  `Encounters† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Encounters>`__, p. 114.
5.  `Evasion and
    Pursuit <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Evasion_and_Pursuit>`__, p. 116.
6.  `Combat† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Combat#Combat_Sequence_Per_Round>`__, p. 120.
7.  `Strongholds,
    Construction† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Strongholds#Construction>`__, p. 134.
8.  `NPC Encounters, Adventuring
    Parties <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Adventuring_Parties>`__, p. 212.  While not numbered this is sequence of bullet listed procedures for generating Basic and Expert NPC parties, and High Level NPCs.
9.  `Designing a
    Dungeon† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Designing_a_Dungeon>`__, p. 224.
10. `Designing a
    Wilderness† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Designing_a_Wilderness>`__, p. 226.
11. `Designing a Base
    Town† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Designing_a_Base_Town>`__, p. 227.
12. `Placing Treasure <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Placing_Treasure>`__, p. 229.

    a. `Rolling a Sentient Sword† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Sentient_Swords>`__, p. 272.
    b.  `Control Checks† <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Sentient_Swords#Control_Checks>`__, p. 273.

The fact that OSE has an online
`SRD <https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/>`__ is also an
advantage; S&W used to, but it is not currently available.

Swords & Wizardry
=================

Procedures
----------

In Swords & Wizardry there are only a couple of step-by-step procedures.

1. Initiative and Order of Battle†, p. 35.
2. Generating a Random Treasure Hoard†, p. 131.

Swords & Wizardry’s other procedures have to be extracted from one or
more paragraphs of running text.

S&W tends to rely on examples and prose descriptions rather than
explicitly numbered or bulleted lists.

“Monsters in the Dungeon”, p. 76, could easily have been part of a
“Randomly Stoking the Dungeon” procedure.

Compare OSE's “Wilderness Adventuring” to S&W's “Wilderness
Adventures” on p. 80.  The OSE version is an explicit list of steps,
while the S&W version is a wall of text.

Compare OSE‘s bulleted Morale procedure, p. 123, to S&W's, p. 39.

Compare OSE's “Rolling a Sentient Sword” to S&W's “Intelligent
Weapons”, p. 138.

*****

I'm sure that the designer of S&W and its ardent players use
procedures much like OSE's to actually run the game published,
internalized as good practice from the original games over the users,
until they don't notice the lack of or more difficult presentation of
these procedures in S&W.

Much of the credit for OSE's procedures goes to Moldvay, Cook, and
Marsh, who designed the version of D&D it retroclones, but much also
goes to the exceptionally clear presentation of those rules by Gavin
Norman of `Necrotic Gnome <https://necroticgnome.com/>`_.  The series
of OSE adventures_ also published by Necro Gnome have also been
excellently presented.

I have been pleased to see S&W's presentation improving over time (the
use of two page spreads for most of the class presentations in the
most recent S&W Revised was a great improvement), and I expect to see
the presentation continue to improve.
