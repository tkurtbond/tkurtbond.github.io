+ *The Godwulf Manuscript*, by Robert B. Parker; read by Michael
  Prichard; Books on Tape, 1998.  This is the first time I've read (or
  heard read) any of Parker's Spenser novels, I think. Entertaining, in
  a light manner. Prichard's reading was quite appropriate.
+ *Voyager*, by Diana Gabaldon; Dell, November 1994.  This is the third
  of Gabaldon's series about Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser. Enjoyable,
  if the timetravelling aspect doesn't make you cringe.
+ *The Magic Engineer*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr, copyright 1994; July,
  1995.  This is the third in published order of Modesit's *Magic of
  Recluce* series.
+ *Resurrection Men*, by Ian Rankin; copyright 2002 by John Rebus
  Limited; Little, Brown, and Company.
+ *1633*, by David Weber and Eric Flint; Baen, August 2002.  It's
  interesting to see how recent “Americans in the Past” books tend
  to have the timelost Americans make their greatest impact on the past
  via their imported political systems and their technology only
  secondarily. In any case, this book is fun.
+ *The Sorcerer's Soul*, by Ron Edwards; Adept Press, 2001.  This is the
  second supplement for Ron Edwards's *Sorcerer* roleplaying game. Where
  *Sorcerer and Sword* adapted the original game to a new genre, this
  supplement is more of an elaboration of ideas from the original game,
  additional examples of what you can do with the game and how you can
  use it in different settings (though in the same genre). I found the
  relationship map method of scenario preparation particularly
  interesting. Well worth reading.
