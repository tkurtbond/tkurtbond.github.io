+ *The Reverse of the Medal*, by Patrick O'Brian; William Collins & Co
  Ltd, 1986; W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 1992.  I've always found this
  one of the most difficult books in the series to read, finding Jack
  Aubrey's difficulties in this volume most unpleasant to bear. On the
  other hand, the ultimate scene with Maturin and Duhamel is very
  satisfying.
+ *The Letter of Marque*, by Patrick O'Brian; William Collins & Co
  Ltd, 1988; W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 1992.  This book contains one of
  my favorite long passges in the series, Stephen Maturin's journey to
  be see his estranged wife.
+ *The Thirteen Gun Salute*, by Patrick O'Brian; William Collins & Co
  Ltd, 1989; ; W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 1992.

  W. Norton & Company, Inc, 1993.

  Company, Inc, 1993.
