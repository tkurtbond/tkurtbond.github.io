+ *The Yellow Admiral*, by Patrick O'Brian; W.W. Norton & Company,
  Inc, 1996.  This is another diffcult volume in the saga for me to read,
  with Aubrey's worries about his career prospects, the estrangement of
  his wife, and more money problems, and Bonden's injury all
  contributing to the tribulations of Aubrey and Maturin.
