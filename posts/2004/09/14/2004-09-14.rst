Web Browsing: Elinks
--------------------

I do a fair amount of text-only browsing of the web, and elinks is the
best text-mode web browser I've found so far. It works well for my
style of browing â€” open lots of tabs in the background as I'm
reading and then work through reading them all. For this I need a
browser that has easy keyboard navigation and good support for tabs
and background loading. Once I found out that pressing shift while
selecting text would actually allow the text to be selected I made
elinks my standard text-mode browser.
