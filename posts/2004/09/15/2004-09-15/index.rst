I was reading Patrick O'Brian's *The Commodore* (W.W. Norton & Co,
Inc, New York, 1995) and was struck by these two quotes:

    “Sickness has innumerable squalors, many of which you know far too
    well, my dear,” he said when Jack and he were sitting together in the
    great cabin, “and among them, in some ways the nastiest, is the
    sufferer's total selfishness. Admittedly, a body doing all it can to
    survive will naturally turn in upon itself; but the mind inhabiting
    that body is so inclined to feast on the indulgence, carrying on and
    on long after the necessity is gone.”  — Stephen, on p. 231

    “... there is no heart to change: no person left: only a set of
    pompous attitutes.”  — Jack, on p. 234
