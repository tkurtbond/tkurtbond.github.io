+ *Outlander*, by Diana Gabaldon; Delacorte Press, 1991.  There's
  something about time-travel books written outside the science-fiction
  realm that I find offputting, and I definitely prefer my historical
  fiction unadulterated by such things, but this series is reasonably
  good despite that.
+ *Dragonfly in Amber*, by Diana Gabaldon; Delacorte Press, 1992.
+ *The Wizard of Karres*, by Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint, and Dave
  Freer; Baen, 2004.  James H. Schmitz wrote a number of enjoyable tales,
  including that delightful romp *The Witches of Karres*. *The Wizard of
  Karres* is a reasonably good sequel. I'll have to re-read the original
  sometime soon.
