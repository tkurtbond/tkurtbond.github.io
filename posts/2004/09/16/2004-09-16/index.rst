+ *The Commodore*, by Patrick O'Brian, copyright 1994; W.W. Norton &
  Company, Inc, 1994.  I find the latter books in the Aubrey/Maturin saga
  more difficult to read, not because they are of lessor quality or more
  difficult in and of themselves, but rather because the protagonists'
  lives are more emotionally strained than in the earier books. In this
  book Maturin is harrowed by the condition of his young daughter, who
  he meets for the first time after years away at sea, and the
  estrangment from his wife that has resulted. But there is hope for
  both problems. And there is at least one very important first meeting
  in this book that will have many influences in the rest of the series.
