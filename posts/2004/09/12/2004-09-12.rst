A conflict: on the one hand I'm attracted to the detail and broad
applicability of games like GURPS, CORPS, and Hero (especially the
effects-based powes frameworks of the latter two), but on the other
hand I'm oppressed by the work involved in creating anything using
them. BESM seems to be the best balance in this area that I've found
so far, and while so I'm looking forward to the 3rd edition, I'm quite
happy with the 2nd edition, revised.

And on the gripping there is the opposite extreme, with games like
Over the Edge, Risus, Story Engine, and Fudge, which have (or can
have) minimal details and very simple rules.
