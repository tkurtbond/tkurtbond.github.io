+ *Blue Moon*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, November 1998.  Eighth in
  the series.
+ *Obsidian Butterfly*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, OctoberÂ 2000.
  Ninth in the series.  We find out a lot more about Edward.
+ *Narcissus in Chains*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Jove, October 2002.
+ *Dead to the World*, by Charlaine Harris; Ace, May 2004.  These are
  not as intense as Hamilton's *Anita Blake* books, but I enjoy the
  small-town aspect of Harris's books.
+ *Gardens of the Moon: Volume One of the Malazan Book of the Fallen*,
  by Steven Erikson; Tor, June 2004.  Interesting high magic world with an
  expanding empire.  *Not* much like Glen Cook.  This first book has a
  military organization in one of its main threads, and a good deal of
  gritty details, but it also has an much higher level of magic.
+ *In the Kingdom of the Mists*, by Jane Jakeman; Berkeley Prime
  Crime, March 2004.  Quirky thriller with Monet as a peripheral but
  important character.  Good.
+ *Redwall*, by Brian Jacques; narrated by Ron Keith; Recorded Books,
  1995.  Well read by Keith, but something about it was annoying.  I
  suspect I'd have liked it better if I was 12, which is probably a
  failing on my part.
