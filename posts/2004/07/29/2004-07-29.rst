+ *The Fortune of War*, by Patrick O'Brian, copyright 1979; first
  published by William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd, 1979; W.W. Norton &
  Company, 1991.  Captivity in the U.S.A. with intrigue and the
  contemplation of the decay of affections, followed by escape and the
  taking of the *USN Chesapeake*.  One of the most emotionally involving
  books in the series, leavened with interludes of intense action and
  despair.
