Ada and doing things right
--------------------------

I enjoy reading the newsgroup `comp.lang.ada <news:comp.lang.ada>`__,
because there are number of people there who are doing commercial work
with very high quality requirements and interesting problems to solve.
It's nice to listen to folks who really work to get things *right*.
And sometimes it's just a relief to read code that's written with a
clear syntax.

Speaking of Ada 200Y, Martin Dowie has `back-port to Ada 95
<http://www.martin.dowie.btinternet.co.uk/>`__ of some of the new `Ada
200Y packages <http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&
