+ *When the Legends Die*, by Hal Borland, copyright 1963; narrated by
  Norman Dietz; Recorded Books, Inc., 1991.  I read this book when I was a
  young teenager.  When I listened to it this time (in my car, mostly
  going to and from work), I was struck again by how the new medium
  presented it a-new to my mind, striking afresh into my thoughts.
+ *Rupert of Hentzau*, by Anthony Hope; first published in Great
  Britian by J.W. Arrowsmith in 1898; published in one volume with *The
  Prisoner of Zenda* by Penguin Books, 2000.  I've read *The Prisoner of
  Zenda* several times, read new interpretations of it by George
  MacDonald Fraser and others, and seen at least a couple of movie
  versions of it, but I'd never read its sequel, *Rupert of Hentzau*.  It
  apparently wasn't as popular as the original, and has been criticised
  as too complicated and not active enough, and I can understand why.
  However, it's still a worthwhile read on its own merits, and it does
  serve to complete the story that *The Prisoner of Zenda* left open.
