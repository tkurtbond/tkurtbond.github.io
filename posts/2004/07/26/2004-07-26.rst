+ *The Mote in God's Eye*, by Larry Niven, copyright 1974; Timescape,
  Pocket Books, Simon and Schuster, 1974.  Still fun to read.
+ *Queen's Gambit Declined*, by Melinda M. Snodgrass, copyright 1989;
  Questar, Popular Library, Warner Books.  An antifantasy, and very good.
+ *The Opal-Eyed Fan*, by Andre Norton, copyright 1977; E.P. Dutton,
  1977.  This is one of Norton's historicals, and is set on one of the
  Florida Keys in the middle 1800s.  I like Norton's science fiction
  better, but the historicals are good.
