+ *Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle Earth*, by John
  Garth; Houghton Miffllin, 2003.  This meticulous new biography of
  J.R.R.  Tolkien during the years of World War I lays the groundwork
  for Garth's eloquent argument that Tolkien's fiction, rather than
  being an escape from reality, is Tolkien's reflection on and
  reaction to his experiences as a combatant in World War II. Despite
  its very specialized nature it's quite interesting, and Garth argues
  convincingly.  It its own specialized way, it is quite as good as
  Tom Shippey's `The Road to Middle Earth
  <link://slug/2003-11-09-the-road-to-middle-earth>`__ and
  `J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century
  <link://slug/2003-11-22-sbcl-author-of-the-century#author-of-the-century>`__,
  although I think that Shippey's books have wider appeal.
