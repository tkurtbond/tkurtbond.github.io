+ *In the Forests of Serre*, by Patricia A. McKillip; Ace Books (an
  imprint of the Berkley Publishing Group), 2003.  This is another one of
  McKillip's delightful fantasies.

RPGs Need Campaigns
-------------------

I think that the most important supplement for a a newly introduced
roleplaying game setting (whether part of a dedicated RPG or as a
supplement for a generic RPG) is a campaign.  I'm thinking of things
like *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay*'s *The Enemy Within* campaign, or
any of several *Call of Cthulhu* campaigns, or *Pendragon*'s *The Boy
King*.  You really need a good campaign to see extended examples of
what a setting can do.
