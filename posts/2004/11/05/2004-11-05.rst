+ *Brand of The Werewolf*, as by Kenneth Robeson; online sources say
  it was actually written by Lester Dent and originally published
  January 1934 in Doc Savage Magazine.  Doc Savage Adventure #11. I
  probably got this from `memoware <http://www.memoware.com/?screen=doc_
  detail&doc_id=14792&p=category%5E!Adventure~!&sort_by=rating&start=0>`__,
  a site that distributes free ebooks for PDAs. It introduces
  Patricia Savage, Doc Savage's cousin. Entertaining, in a pulp way.
+ *The Shadow of the Ship*, by Robert Wilfred Franson; Del
  Rey/Ballantine, 1983.  Interesting, if slightly uneven. While a complete
  novel in itself, it starts in the middle of things and leaves you
  wanting to know more about the many things alluded to in passing. As
  far as I can tell it was a standalone novel. Was it his only
  novel?William H. Stoddard has a good `review
  <http://www.troynovant.com/Stoddard/Franson/Shadow-of-the-
  Ship.html>`__ of the book from the libertarian viewpoint. Update
  (2008-01-27): looking closer at the `Troynovant
  <http://www.troynovant.com/>`__ web site I see that it is a collection
  of interesting essays on many topics, including books and movies as
  well as other subjects, with a Libertarian viewpoint, apparently run
  by Robert Wilfred Franson, the author of *The Shadow of the Ship*.
