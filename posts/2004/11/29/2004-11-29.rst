+ *H.M.S. Cockerel*, by Dewey Lambdin; copyright 1995; Fawcett
  Crest/Ballantine Books, March 1997.  Another good entry in the saga of
  Alan Lewrie.
+ *The White Order*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
  Inc, May 1998.  As you might expect from the title, this volume of
  Modesitt's *Reculse* series is from the viewpoint of a white magician,
  instead of the black or grey magicians who have been the viewpoint
  characters previously. (In the *Recluce* books the words “white”,
  “black”, and “grey” don't refer to the morals of the magician,
  but to whether they use chaos, order, or a balance of the two forces.)
