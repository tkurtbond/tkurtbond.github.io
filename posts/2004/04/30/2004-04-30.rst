On April 30th, 2004 `Black Library <http://www.blacklibrary.com/>`__,
the publishing arm of `Games Workshop
<http://www.gamesworkshop.com/>`__, `announced
<http://www.blacklibrary.com/news.html?id=436&offset=0>`__ that they
were launching a new imprint, `Black Industries
<http://www.blackindustries.com/>`__, to publish roleplaying games,
and that Black Industries, working with `Green Ronin
<http://www.greenronin.com/>`__ `(press release)
<http://www.greenronin.com/press_releases/?id=games_workshop>`__,
would publish a new edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.  Early fear
and trepidation on the part of some fans was quickly dispelled in a
`thread
<http://www.criticalhit.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=10945>`__ in the
`Critical Hits <http://www.criticalhit.co.uk/>`__ Warhammer Fantasy
Roleplay `forum
<http://www.criticalhit.co.uk/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=6>`__ when
Simon Butler from Black Industries answered a great number of
questions: WFRP 2nd edition would *not* be a D20 game, it would use a
revised version of the original WFRP system, and it would strive to
keep the grim and perilous tone of the original game, and many fans
expressed their opionion that Green Ronin was a good choice to develop
the new WFRP.

I was overjoyed to hear this news; WFRP has long been one of my
favorite fantasy roleplaying games for its combination of interesting
if quirky system and excellent setting and adventures.  I'm looking
forward to the new edition.
