+ *Sanctuary*, by Lynn Abbey; Tor, 2003.  This is the first of the books
  in the new *Thieves' World* series of collaborative anthologies; it's
  a novel that explains the recent history and sets up the current
  situation in the city offically known as Sanctuary but called Thieves'
  World by everybody.  It picks up many years after the events of the
  last of the twelve books in the earlier series, and introduces a
  number of interesting new characters.  I enjoyed the orignal series when
  it came out; it was perhaps the first intentional shared world
  anthology series, and proved an interesting experiment, although
  somewhat uneven in execution.  It spawned a number of imitators;
  especially notable were the *Liavek* and *Merovingen Nights*.  There
  were places toward the end of the series where Thieves' World dragged
  a lot, and it suffered from escalation problems, but overall it was
  very good.  I was interested to see if it could be revieved
  successfully, and was pleased by this excellent bridging novel.(I
  actually read this a few weeks or a month ago, but forgot to write
  about it.)
+ *Thieves' World: Turning Points*, edited by Lynn Abbey; written by
  Lynn Abbey, Mickey Zucker Reichert, Andrew Offutt, Diana L. Paxson,
  Selina Rosen, Dennis L. McKiernan, Robin Wayne Bailey, Jody Lynn Nye,
  Jeff Grubb, Raymond E. Feist; Tor, 2002.  This is the first of the
  collections in the new *Theives' World* series; it was a fun read,
  although somewhat uneven in excecution, and not as good as
  *Sanctuary*.  I'm looking forward to the next anthology.
