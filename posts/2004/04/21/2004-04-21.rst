+ *Sun's End*, by Richard Lupoff; Berkley Books, 1984.  Ends without any
  resolution of anything; very annoying.  Contra-recommended.
+ *The Magic of Recluce*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr; Tor, 1991.  Interesting
  magic and social systems.  Recommended.
+ *The Queen's Man*, by Sharon Kay Penman; Henry Holt and Company,
  1996.  A very good historical mystery.
