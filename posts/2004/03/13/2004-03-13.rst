+ *City of Bones*, by Martha Wells; Tor, 1995.  This tale is set in an
  interesting post holocaust world (almost certainly not our own) where
  Charisat, the Imperial city, rules a collection of city-states on the
  edge of a great desert waste waste that was once a sea.  It has a
  number of interesting characters, a sense that there is more to the
  world than this one story revealed (a good thing), and does not end
  the easy way.  It is an enjoyable fantasy that is not derived from any
  of the obvious sources; well worth reading.
