+ *Hrolf Kraki's Saga*, by Poul Anderson; original copyright 1973,
  Baen 1988.  I don't know the source material Anderson used so I can't
  judge how authentic it is, but as a fictional treatment it seems very
  coherent.  Definitely worth reading, especially to those who are
  interested in the root sources of fantasy literature.
