Recent Reading
--------------

+ *Trollslayer*, *Skavenslayer*, *Daemonslayer*, by William King;
  Games Workshop Publishing, 2000.  I finally got around to reading these
  *Gotrek and Felix* books set in the world of Games Workshop's
  *Warhammer* games.  I don't play any of Games Workshop's miniatures
  games, but I do play *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay* when I can, and it
  is set in what's more-or-less the same world.  (WFRP was published in
  1989 and GWs repeated revisions of their *Warhammer* games and the
  world they are set in has increasingly diverged from the grimmer,
  grittier, low-powered world seen in WFRP.) They're ok for gaming
  fiction, and have a few interesting glimpses of the world in them.  I
  tend to leave the steam tanks and flying machines out of my version of
  the Warhammer world, though, and judging by *Skavenslayer* and
  *Daemonslayer* those elements are increasingly common in the stories
  of Gotrek and Felix.

I've been playing around with `OpenRPG <http://www.openrpg.com/>`__ a
little bit lately, and it seems to work reasonably well.  It provides
multi-user text-based chat, a shared map with miniatures, an a few
other things useful for people playing pen-and-paper adventure games
online.  On problem that the current 1.6.1 release has is with the `fog
<http://forums.rpghost.com/showthread.php?s=ce2507f5746e01fe771a62e8b9
9dea52&threadid=14758>`__ feature: in 1.6.1 there is a bug that causes
massive instability when the fog feature of the map is used.  However,
there is a `patch <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detai
l&aid=887790&group_id=2237&atid=302237>`__ for it that fixes the
problem.
