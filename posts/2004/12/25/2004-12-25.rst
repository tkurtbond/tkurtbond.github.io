+ *Under the Green Star*, by Lin Carter; DAW, 1972; No. 30.  In the
  1970s Lin Carter wrote some “planetary romances”, including the
  *Green Star* series, in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *Mars*
  books and others. I prefer Carter's *Wizard of Zao* (where, it seems
  to me, Carter achieved a sense of light humorous fantasy that has
  rarely been equaled), but the *Green Star* series is a fair tribute to
  the genre of planetary romances, though it lacks the breadth and depth
  of its near contemporary, Kenneth Bulmer's extensive *Kregen* novels
  about Dray Prescot. In any case, I'll have to find the fourth and
  fifth books in the *Green Star* series sometime.
+ *When the Green Star Calls*, by Lin Carter; DAW, 1973; UE1732.
+ *By the Light of the Green Star*, by Lin Carter; DAW, 1974; No. 110.
+ *The Tombs of Atuan*, by Ursula K. Le Guin, copyright 1970, 1971;
  originally published by Atheneum, 1971; Bantam Books, September 1975;
  14th printing, January 1981.  This was the first of Le Guin's *Earthsea*
  books that I read, when I was a youngster, and I found it utterly
  fascinating then and now.
