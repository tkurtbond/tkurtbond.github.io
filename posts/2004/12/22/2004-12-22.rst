+ *Raven Swordsmistress of Chaos*, by Richard Kirk, copyright 1978;
  Ace Fantasy/The Berkley Publishing Group, 1987.  A fair example of the
  later generation Swords and Sorcery fiction.
+ *A Wizard of Earthsea*, by Ursula K. Le Guin, text copyright 1968;
  illustrated by Ruth Robbins, illustrations copyright 1968; originally
  published by Parnassus Press, 1968; Bantam Books, Inc, August 1975,
  10th printing sometime post November 1977.  I'm in the process of
  watching the SciFi Channel's disappointing attempt to bring Earthsea
  to TV; `Ursula K. Le Guin <http://www.ursulakleguin.com/>`__ `explains
  the movies flaws <http://slate.msn.com/id/2111107/>`__ much better
  than I could, of course, but it inspired me to re-read the *Earthsea*
  books again. As I reread the first book I was struck by how lyrical
  the writing is and how the book is layered with meaning, without being
  preachy.
