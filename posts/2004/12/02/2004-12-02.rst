+ *The Wilding*, by C.S. Friedman; DAW Books Collectors No 1296; DAW
  Books, 2004.
+ *Cravings*; Jove, July 2004.

  + “Blood upon My Lips”, by Laurell K. Hamilton.

    I'll admit that I originally only picked this up at the library
    because it starts with Larry Kirkland's wedding. It turns out,
    however, to actually be a rather important day in Anita Blake's
    life for other reasons.
  + “Dead Girls Don't Dance”, by MaryJanice Davidson.

    I guess I'm going to have to look and see if there are more Andrea
    Mercer and Danial Harris stories.
  + “Orginally Human”, by Eileen Wilks.

    Molly and Michael Grace are an interesting pair.
  + “Burning Moon”, by Ruth Glick writing as Rebecca York.

    All in all, a very good book.
