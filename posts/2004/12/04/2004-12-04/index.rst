Hard SF
-------

Over on `rpg.net <http://forum.rpg.net>`__ Eric Tolle `said
<http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=3240359&postcount=20>`__:

    Hard SF is indeed a constantly shifting goalpost- over the years it's
    gott[e]n considerably more rigid and limiting.

    …

    Over the last decade the meaning has shifted from "Well thought out
    plausible extrapolation" to "No physical laws as we know them
    violated". It currently seems to be slowly shifting to the level of
    “No technology that we currently don't have”, which means that
    probably if the trend continues, in about fifteen years “hard SF” will
    be defined as “Books like the Kinsey Malone mystery stories”.

I think it would be a pity if the first definition stopped being used
entirely, since that would eliminate a lot of thoughtful, interesting
stories. And while the second definition is useful, I don't think the
third is: we already have the Kinsey Malone mystery stories, after
all. Science Fiction must continue to concern itself with the
possibilities of the future.

Recent Reading
--------------

+ *The Darkness that Comes Before*, by R. Scott Bakker, copyright
  2003; Overlook Press/Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc, 2004.  This is
  described ss *The Prince of Nothing*, Book One, so I'm looking forward
  to seeing more books in this series. A very good non-psuedo-medieval
  fantasy, with an interesting cast of characters and some intriguing
  background. In some ways it reminds me of Glen Cook's *Tower of Fear*,
  although it may have a somewhat larger scope.

Recent Listening
----------------

+ *Sharpe's Escape*, by Bernard Cornwell; narrated by Patrick Tull;
  Recorded Books, LLC, 2004.  Portugal, 1810; Sharpe becomes separated
  from his regiment as the British retreat to the Lines of Tores Vedras.
  Well read by Patrick Tull.
