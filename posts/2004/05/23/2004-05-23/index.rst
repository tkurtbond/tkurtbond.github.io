+ *The Towers of the Sunset*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr; Tor, 1993.  This is,
  I think, the second of Modesitt's *Recluce* in order of publication,
  though not by the series' internal chronology.  It tells of the
  founding of Recluce, and contains some more interesting looks at the
  magic of Recluce.  Enjoyable non-psuedo-Medieval fantasy.
+ *Hide & Seek*, by Ian Rankin, copyright 1990; Otto Penzler
  Books,Â 1994.  I started reading the *Rebus* books later in the
  series; it's interesting to see Rebus in the middle of his
  career.  Enjoyable Scottish police mystery.
