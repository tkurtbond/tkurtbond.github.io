+ *Sharpe's Escape*, by Bernard Cornwell; HarperCollins, USA,Â 2004.
  This volume of Sharpe's adventures takes place during the Bussaco
  campaign in Portugal in 1810, starting at Bussaco, visiting Coimbra,
  and ending along the Lines of Torres Vedras, near the Tagus River.
  While it maintains the formula (another incompetent British officer
  to plague Sharpe, another vicious enemy, another woman) the main
  characters remain engaging and the historical background
  fascinating.  I enjoyed the homage to C.S. Forester.  Overall, it was
  another good episode in the Sharpe saga.
