+ *Pandora's Legions*, by Chirstopher Anvil, edited by Eric Flint;
  Baen Books, February 2002.  This novel was constructed from Anvil's
  earlier novel from 1972, *Pandora's Planet*, itself based on an
  earlier novella published as “Pandora's Planet” in the September
  1956 *Astounding*, combined with a number of related short stories
  from the 1960s.  Flint has woven the different stories together well.
+ *The Bloody Red Baron*, by Kim Newman; Avon Books, 1997.  The sequel
  to `Anno Dracula`__, this book brings us forward forward from the
  end of Victoria's reign to the first world war.  Geneviéve is
  missing from this novel, alas, but Charles Beauregard and Kate Reed
  return, joined this time by Edgar Allan Poe.  Enjoyable.

* `Bubba Ho-tep <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/>`__, 2002.
  Directed by Don Coscarelli; short story by Joe R. Lansdale, screenplay
  by Don Coscarelli.  Starring Bruce Campbell, Ossie Davis, Ella Joyce,
  Heidi Marnhout, and Bob Ivy.

  In the words of Bruce Campbell, *Bubba Ho-tep*, is a redemptive Elvis
  mummy movie.  It's great fun, whatever it is.  Bruce Campbell does a
  wonderful job as Elvis.  Very enjoyable.
