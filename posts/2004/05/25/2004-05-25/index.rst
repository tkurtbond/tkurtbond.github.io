+ *An Unpardonable Crime*, by Andrew Taylor, copyright 2004; Theia
  Books, an imprint of Hyperion Books, 2004.  This intriguing historical
  crime novel includes a young Edgar Allan Poe in a supporting role and
  a number of other, if less historical, interesting characters.  Very
  good.  Taylor has a number of other books that I will now seek out.
