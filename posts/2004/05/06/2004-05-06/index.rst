Mark Arsenault, president of Gold Rush Games, had some unhappy
observations on the health of the RPG industry in his post `Changes in
the Air: A GRG Update for our Fans
<http://www.goldrushgames.com/forums/index.php?act=ST&f=2&t=384>`__ on
the Gold Rush Games forums on May 5th.  One item in particular was the
small sales size:

    [T]he general consensus is that sales are down across the board (with
    new product sales in the 200-800 unit range; very low compared to just
    2 years ago)...

The market leaders, of course, are selling in larger quantities, but
even if these sales figures are only common among the second tier
companies it's still ominous.  Why have sales declined like this? Ron
Edwards `has argued <http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/12/>`__ in the
past that this is due to the myth that a successful game must be an
large rulebook supported by an ongoing stream of extensive support
materials.  Others have suggested that part of the problem is the
`supplement treadmill <http://www.indie-
