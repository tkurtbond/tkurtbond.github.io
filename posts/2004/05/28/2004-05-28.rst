+ *Neuromancer*, by William Gibson, copyright 1984; Books on Tape,
  1994.  Read by Arthur Addison.  It's been several years since I've re-
  read *Neuromancer*, but I was surprised by how much impact listening
  to it for the first time had: I think it recaptured a lot of the
  newness of the experience of reading it for the first time.
  *Neuromancer* is often credited as launching the cyberpunk genre;
  although there were earlier books with similar themes *Neuromancer*
  seems to have been the first to make a big impact on SF-reading
  public.  Books with a significant computer component often age
  ungracefully, and there are a very few places in this book where I
  wince a little, but on the whole it stands up well.  Well worth reading
  and re-reading.
