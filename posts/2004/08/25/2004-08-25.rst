Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Sennen joyu <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291350/>`__, aka
  *Millennium Actress*, 2001; directed by Satoshi Kon, written by
  Satoshi Kon and Sadayuki Murai.  An interesting anime, well worth
  seeing, though I suspect it would have been better had I some
  familiarity with Japanese film history.

Arthur Wakes?
-------------

It was recently `announced
<http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=142503>`__ that Arthaus
Publishing, the `White Wolf <http://www.white-wolf.com/>`__ imprint,
had purchased the rights and back stock of the *Pendragon* Aurthurian
roleplaying game from Peter Corless of `Green Knight Publishing
<http://www.greenknight.com/>`__. Stewart Wieck `confirmed
<http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=2816416&postcount=7>`__ that they
*would* selling the existing and also developing new projects that
would keep the current rules, with perhaps some tweaking. James Lowder
of Green Knight `confirmed
<http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=2818869&postcount=40>`__ that
Arthaus will have access to all the unpublished works that have been
written for Pendragon, so perhaps we'll finally get to see some of
them.

I find this very encouraging; Arthaus has the resources to support
*Pendragon* and they seem to have produced some reasonably good books.
I'm looking forward to seeing new Pendragon materials.
