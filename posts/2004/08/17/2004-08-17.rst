+ *Lord John and the Private Matter*, by Diana Gabaldon; A Delacorte
  Book, published by Bantam Dell, a division of Random House, Inc,
  October 2003.  This is the first of Gabaldon's novels about Lord John
  Grey, and the first of Gabaldon's works that I've read.  A historical
  mystery set at the beginning of the Seven Years War, it takes a short
  but sympathetic look in passing at the gay subculture of London.  It's
  a fairly good historical; I'll have to look and see what her other
  books are like.
