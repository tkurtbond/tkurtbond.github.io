+ *Death Comes as Ephiphany*, by `Sharan Newman
  <http://www.hevanet.com/sharan/>`__, copyright 1993; read by Donada
  Peters; Books on Tape, 1998.  (Apparently her name was misspelled as
  Sharon by Books on Tape.) A very good medieval mystery, with a broader
  range than I had first supposed.  I had not realized that this was only
  the first of a series featuring Catherine Levendur.
