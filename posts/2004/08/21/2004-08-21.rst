+ `Kill Bill vol. 2 <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/>`__,
  directed by Quentin Tarantino, 2004.  `“People who like this sort of
  thing will find this the sort of thing they like.”
  <http://www.bartleby.com/66/7/36407.html>`__ That said, it's
  interesting to note that it's not just more of the same as the first
  movie.  Most of what little story there is in the two movies is in this
  one, and more of the backstory is revealed.  Worth renting.
