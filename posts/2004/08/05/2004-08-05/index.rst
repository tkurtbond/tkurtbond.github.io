+ *Hell's Faire*, by John Ringo; Baen, May 2003.  Lots of fun; it was
  worth re-reading.
+ *Wren to the Rescue*, by Sherwood Smith, copyright 1990; Firebird,
  an imprint of Penguin Group, 2004.  *Crown Duel* by Smith was
  excellent, and this one is too, though in a different way.  `Firebird
  <http://www.firebirdbooks.com>`__, judging by the list (opposite the
  title page) of other books they're publishing, is looking to reprint a
  *bunch* of good books, including some of Lloyd Alexander's *Westmark*
  books; I wish them every success.  I wonder if they're focusing on
  young adult books?
