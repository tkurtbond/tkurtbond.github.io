+ *Glory Lane*, by Alan Dean Foster, copyright 1987; Ace, August
  1987.  Amusing in some respects, but one of Foster's lesser efforts.
+ *The Surgeon's Mate*, by Patrick O'Brian, copyright 1981; First
  published in 1980 by William Collins Sons & Co Ltd; W.W. Norton and
  Company, Inc, 1992.  After facing the apparent diminution of the
  affections that have driven him for years, Stephen Maturin finds that
  they have *not* diminished, rather that they have been muted for a
  time, and is given the strongest possible evidence that his affections
  are returned in a measure greater than he could have hoped for, with
  the long-sought but previously unlikely outcome.  Strongly recommended,
  but it's necessary to have read a number of other books in the series
  for the full effect, perhaps most importantly *Post Captain*.
