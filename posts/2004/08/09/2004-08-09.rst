+ *The Judgment of Caesar*, by Steven Saylor; St. Martin's Minotaur,
  June 2004.  The last three books or so books of Saylor's *Roma Sub Rosa*
  series have struck me as more unhappy than usual; this one continues
  in that vein until the unexpected end.  Saylor's series remains my
  favorite of the current batch of Roman mysteries, and this is a worthy
  addition.
