+ `Big Trouble in Little China
  <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/>`__, 1986.  Directed by John
  Carpenter, written by Gary Goldman, David Z. Weinstein and W.D.
  Richter.  I watched this movie for the first time tonight; it's a fun
  movie that doesn't take itself seriously, a very good thing.
