+ *Seduced by Moonlight*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ballantine Books,
  2004.  This is the third book in her “Meredith Gentry” series about
  the mortal Faerie princess and private detective.  Like her “Anita
  Blake” books, Hamilton has continued to increse the amount of sex in
  these books, and the sex scenes are very graphic now; however, the sex
  is an integral part of the story, not just tacked on, and the writing
  continues to be very good.  Overall, an enjoyable book.
+ *Daredevel*, 2003.  Directed by Mark Steven Johnson; staring Ben
  Affleck and Jennifer Garner.  This was an ok movie; worth renting or
  watching on cable.
