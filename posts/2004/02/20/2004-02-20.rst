+ `Kumonosu jo <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0050613/>`__, 1957.
  (Also known as *Throne of Blood*.) Directed by Akira Kurosawa, written
  by Shinobu Hashimoto, Ryuzo Kikushima, Akira Kurosawa, and Hideo
  Oguni, and starring Toshir√¥ Mifune.  Akira Kurosawa's reworking of
  *Macbeth* is interesting, but not as compelling as `Yojimbo
  <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0055630/>`__ or `Shichinin no samurai
  <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0047478/>`__.  Again, from IFC's Samurai
  Saturday.
