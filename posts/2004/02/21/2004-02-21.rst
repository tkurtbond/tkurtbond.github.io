My wife is surprised that I enjoy the TV series `Tremors`; she
categorizes it as Redneck SF. It *is* set in a rural area, and one of
the characters *is* an ex-racecar driver, but I don't think that is
enough to qualify it as Redneck SF. In any case, I enjoy `Tremors`.
Like `The Chronicle`, another TV series that I liked, it doesn't take
itself too seriously.  And, since it doesn't take itself too seriously,
it is easy to take on its own terms, which seem to those of *GURPS
Atomic Horror*, subtitled: “Science Runs Amok in B-Movie
Adventures!”.

As for the Sci Fi channel in general, I wish it had more actual
Science Fiction in its line-up than horror and repulsive “reality”
shows.
