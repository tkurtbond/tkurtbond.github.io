+ *The Chaos Balance*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.; Tor/Tom Doherty
  Associates, Inc., September, 1997.  More information about the earlier
  years of the World of Recluce. Enjoyable alternative to the tide of
  psuedo-Tolkien fantasy.
+ *The Deep Blue Good-By*, by John D. MacDonald (copyright 1964?);
  read by Michael Prichard; Books on Tape, 1983.  This is the first Travis
  McGee book. I don't know whether I have read any of his other Travis
  McGee books (I probably have, and if my library wasn't mostly in boxes
  I'd probably have a chance of telling), but I have read *The Girl, the
  Gold Watch, and Everything*. I think he wrote some other science
  fiction, as well.  In any case, I enjoyed this one; definitely a product
  of the times, but a good story. Prichard's reading was good; his
  particular reading voice seems well suited for this sort of book.
