These books were spread out over the past three weeks or so.

+ *Sharpe's Battle*, by Bernard Cornell; copyright 1995;
  HarperPerennial, 1999.  Sharpe's adventures in Spain, May 1811.
+ *Drums of Autumn*, by Diana Gabaldon; Delacorte Press, January 1997.
+ *The Fall of the Kings*, by Ellen Kushner and Delia Sherman; Bantom
  Books, Novemeber 2002.  This did not hold my attention as well as
  *Swordspoint*, the earlier book by Kushner set in this world; in fact,
  I set it down somewhere in the last two thirds of the book and it sat
  unread for a very long period of time. It is, no doubt, a more
  ambitious book.
+ *The Gun Ketch*, by Dewey Lambdin, copyright 1993; read by John Lee;
  Books on Tape, Inc., 1999.  Well read by John Lee. Well written and rich
  in details.
+ *The Order War*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
  January 1995.
+ *Fall of Angels*, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.; Tor/Tom Doherty Associates,
  Inc., June 1996.  We learn much more about the history of Recluce's world
  in this one; these *Reculse* books are consistently page-turners for
  me.
+ *The Thieves' Opera*, by Lucy Moore, copyright 1997;
  Harvest/Harcourt, Inc., 2000.  Fascinating tour through the criminal
  classes of early- to mid- 1700s London, especially Jonathan Wild and
  Jack Sheppard.
+ *Thrones, Dominations*, by Dorothy L. Sayers & Jill Paton Walsh;
  copyright 1998 by the Truestees of Anthony Fleming (deceased) & Jill
  Paton Walsh; St. Martin's Press, February 1998.  I had not expected to
  enjoy this as much as I did. Why did Sayers stop writing mysteries
  before finishing this, anyway?
+ *The System of the World*, by Neal Stephenson; William
  Morrow/HarperCollins, 2004.  Volume Three of Stephenson's *The Baroque
  Cycle*, this book finishes the series off nicely. Regardless of
  Stephenson's prolixity, these books are great fun.
