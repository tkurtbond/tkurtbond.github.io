Well, it looks like *Talislanta* is going OGL. A couple of days ago
`Morrigan Press <http://www.morriganrpg.com/>`__ `announced
<http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=149767&page=1&pp=10>`__ that
they will be publishing a new version of *Talislanta* using the Open
Game License. From the details described so `far
<http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=2992419&postcount=66>`__, it
sounds like they have a reasonably good plan. They plan to continue to
support the existing *Talislanta* 4th edition rules, dual-stating the
new books other than the new OGL core book, and already have a number
of books planned. I'm no great fan of D20 or OGL, but I think it's
entirely possible to produce a good game using the OGL as a base, and
if this helps publicize Talislanta to those who would have otherwise
missed, that's a good thing. That's a difficult task, though, as
*Dragon Lords of MelnibonÃ«* shows.

Moreover, the previous publishers of *Talislanta*, `Shooting Iron
<http://www.shootingiron.com/>`__, have publicly supported the new
publisher.
