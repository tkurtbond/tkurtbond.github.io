+ *Circus of the Damned*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, MayÂ 1995.
  Richard finally shows up in this, the third book in the *Anita
  Blake* series.  Larry (Lawrence Kirkland) also first appears in this
  book.  Whatever happened to Larry after this book, though? I suppose
  he finished up his semester internship, but did he continue as an
  animator? Did he become a vampire killer? Oh, yes, he returns in
  `Bloody Bones*
  <link://slug/2004-06-18#hamilton-bloody-bones>`__ and `Burnt
  Offerings <link://slug/2004-06-23#hamilton-burnt-
  offerings>`__, at least.
