+ *The Ultimate Cyberpunk*, edited by Pat Cadigan with stories by
  Alfred Bester, Cordwainer Smith, Philip K. Dick, James Tiptree, Jr.,
  Rudy Rucker, William Gibson, Greg Bear, Lewis Shiner, John Shirley,
  Michael Swanwick, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan, Paul J. McAuley;
  Ibooks, April 2004.
+ *The Killing Dance*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, 1997.  Sixth in the
  series.
+ *Burnt Offerings*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, 1998.  I was glad to
  see Larry and amused by the apparent RPG reference: Larry has a
  "higher wisdom score" than Anita.
