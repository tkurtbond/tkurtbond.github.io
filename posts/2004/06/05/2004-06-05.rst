<http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&postid=2486355#post2486355>`__
with people who state that `Fudge <http://www.fudgerpg.com/>`__ is not
a complete game, much less when they state `it's not a game
<http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&postid=2485217#post2485217>`__
at all.  Especially when it's obvious that it is.

+ *The Laughing Corpse*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, September

  to see a little bit more of how animators and necromancy work in
  Anita's world, along with some of the elements that will become
  romance later in the series.  Very good.  Sometimes, though, I wish she'd
  return to the world of her `first book <../../../log/2003/08/05.html
