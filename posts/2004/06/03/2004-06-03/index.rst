+ *Bloodstone*, by Karl Edward Wagner; Warner Books, March 1975.  I
  reread Karl Edward Wagner's *Kane* books every so often.  They are
  wonderful examples of swords and sorcery fiction, filled with blood,
  sweat, strange magic, intrigue, foul rituals, and things from outside
  space.  *Bloodstone* is probably my least favorite of the *Kane*
  novels, but it's still very good.
+ *Guilty Pleasures*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace,
  OctoberÂ 1993.  Hamilton's *Anita Blake* books are also on my
  regularly-reread list.  They started out as an interesting mixture of
  action adventure, detective story, horror, and romance, and have
  intensified each of those elements as the series went on, with
  latter books adding a big dose of sex.  This book is the first, and
  sets up the situation and introduces a many of the recurring
  characters.  Very good.
