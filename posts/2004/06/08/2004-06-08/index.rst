+ *The Lunatic Cafe*, by Laurell K. Hamilton; Ace, JanuaryÂ 1996.
  Continuing with my *Anita Blake* theme, the fourth book in the
  series has moved into full speed, with almost all of the important
  elements of the series, and sets up situations that will take
  serveral books to resolve.  Lots more information on werewolves, and
  the leapards first show up.  Very good.
