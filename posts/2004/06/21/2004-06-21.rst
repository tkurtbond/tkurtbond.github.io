+ *The Smoke Ring*, by Larry Niven; Del Rey/Ballntine 1987.  More fun
  and interesting SF from Niven.
+ *Fool's Fate*, by Robin Hobb; A Bantam Spectra Book/Bantam
  Dell/Random House; 2004.  Enjoyable sixth book of two series.  Robin Hobb
  has also written as Megan Lindholm.  I gather that it's not unusual in
  the current writing market for a mid-list author to have to change
  their nom de plume to be able to publish work.
+ *Confusion*, by Neal Stephenson; HarperCollins, 2004.  This is the
  second volume of Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, and he explains that it's
  actually two intertwined novels published as one.  Like the `earlier
  <link://slug/2003-11-04>`__ volume it's
  very wordy, but enjoyable if you don't mind big books.
