In this short session T.A. finished his two characters,
M.A. created his second character, Jeffrey, a monk, and E.A. created
her characters, Drusilla (Dru), a ranger, and Curufin, an elf.  I
helped E.A. by quickly equipping her characters when time was running
short, while T.A. helped M.A.

T.A. and M.A. were bickering, so I said that they had to roleplay
being best friends.  Glen needed to borrow some money, and I said he
could borrow it from Dooley, but that Dooley would charge 25%
interest, compounded weekly.

Attending
=========

* T.A., playing

  + *Glen the Strategist* (a wizard) and 
  + *Dooley the sly* (a thief) 

     We'd established that Dooley was on the run from the folks in his
     home town who'd burnt his hovel after they'd figured out that
     he was a thief.

* E.A., playing
  + *Curufin the Elf* and 
  + *Drusilla the Ranger*.
* M.A., playing
  + *James the Cleric* and
  + *Jeffrey the Monk*.

[This is an after-the-fact_ entry; I could have sworn I'd written something
about this already, but if so I've lost it.  I'm not sure what date
and time this actually happened.  Sigh.  I think it was nap time for
the youngest kids.]
