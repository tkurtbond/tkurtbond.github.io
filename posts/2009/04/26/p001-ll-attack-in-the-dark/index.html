<h2>Attack in the Dark</h2>
<p>Once the <a class="reference external" href="../../../../../categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> had gotten their characters completed we only had about
30 minutes to play before I had to be elsewhere. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#posts" id="id1">1</a> While they
were finishing their characters, I finally decided to start with <em>B2 —
Keep on the Borderlands</em>, so I started with them approaching the keep
entryway.  We spent a little time in the keep, talking to people and
then left to find the monsters we'd heard were plaguing the area.  The
characters followed the road north where they'd heard merchants had
been attacked, looking for trouble.  They hadn't found any by the end
of the day, so they camped in the bend of the road and set watches
through the night, with no campfire or lights burning.  During
Jeffrey's watch he was surprised by a volley of javelins from the dark
He couldn't really see what was going on, but he woke the others, and
Curufin could see that they were being attacked by orcs.  Jeffrey
started lighting a torch for the humans to see by, Curufin started
shooting his bow at the orcs, Dooley charged up to the orcs to fight
them hand-to-hand, and Drusilla also headed up to the orcs to right.
Despite the penalties for fighting in the dark they were able to score
some hits, and once the torch was light things got easier.  They
finally killed all the orcs.  Pretty much everybody had been injured,
but nobody had been killed.  They decided to start a campfire to
finish out the night with some light.</p>

<div class="section" id="aftermath">
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>There were 6 orcs, with 8 sp, 11 sp, 12 sp, 12 sp, 9 sp, and 12 sp,
respectively.  Each orc had 2 javelins, a short sword, and tatty
leather armor.</p>
<p>[This is an <a class="reference external" href="../../../05/03/after-the-fact/">after-the-fact</a> entry; I could have sworn I'd written something
about this already, but if so I've lost it.  I'm not sure what date
and time this actually happened.  Sigh.  I think it was nap time for
the youngest kids.]</p>
