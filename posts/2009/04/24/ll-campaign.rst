I have decided I'm going to run some classic *D&D* modules this summer
for the kids_.  I'd actually planned on using *Rules Cyclopedia
Dungeons & Dragons*, but unfortunately I'd not yet bought the PDF for
it when Wizards of the Coast took all their PDFs off the market,
saying they were “saving the RPG industry from pirates.”  **Jerks.**
These days I pretty much have to have a PDF of a game I'm going to
run, so, instead of *RC D&D*, we're playing `Labyrinth Lord`_, a
`retro-clone`_ of *Basic/Expert D&D*.  This has some advantages over RC
anyway: there is a free PDF, it's actually in print through Lulu_, and
several adventures have been published for it recently.  I'd
considered using `Swords & Wizardry`_

I want to run *B10 — Night's Dark Terror*, which I think is one of
the classic *D&D* modules, but I didn't want to start with it — it's a
module for 2nd level characters, and I wanted to get a feel for how
*LL* ran, since it has been over 20 years since I last ran a pre-3.5E
*D&D* game.  So, I'm going to start with a different module, and then
either move the characters on to *B10*, or have them create new
characters.  I'm not sure if I'm going to run *B2 — Keep on the
Borderlands* or one of the *LL* adventures yet.

I'm going to have the kids roll up two characters each, inspired by a
*OD&D* (or is it *BD&D* — sometimes it's hard to tell) character sheet
(landscape, double-sided) with two character sheets on it
side-by-side.

I've printed up the character creation sections of *LL* and some *LL*
reference sheets I found online, so each kid will their own booklet to
use during character creation.

[This is a after-the-fact_ entry; I could have sworn I'd written something
about this already, but if so I've lost it.  Sigh.]
