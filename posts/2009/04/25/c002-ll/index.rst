In this short session M.A. completely generated one of his two
characters, James, a cleric, and T.A. tried to finish his two
characters, but didn't get completely there.

[This is a after-the-fact_ entry; I could have sworn I'd written
something about this already, but if so I've lost it.  Sigh.  I'm not
sure what date this actually happened, whether it was the same day as
the zeroth session, or not.]
