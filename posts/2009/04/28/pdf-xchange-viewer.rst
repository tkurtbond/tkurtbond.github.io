I like to stick to Free/Libre (as in freedom) and Open Source Software
as much as I can, but I haven't found a open source program that lets
me add text on existing PDF documents yet, so I use a commercial but
free (as in costs nothing for personal use) program
`PDF-XChange Viewer`_, which can be downloaded here_.

Unlike most of the other commercial but free programs that allow you
to add text to existing documents, PDF-XChange Viewer doesn't add any
nagware watermarking to the document to indicate that it was produced
with the free version, so you can use it fill out forms in PDF
documents that don't have electric form fields, which is very useful on
long forms.

It's not perfect — I've had trouble with it on a few PDFs that seemed
to have pathological defects — but overall it works well.

I'd still rather have a Free/Libre or Open Source program, though.
