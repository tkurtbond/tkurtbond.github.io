* `The Gifts of the Gorboduc Vandal`, by Paul O. Williams, copyright
  1989; Del Rey/Ballantine Books, May 1989; ISBN 0-345-35597-0.

  An interesting science fiction novel by the author of the
  post-apocalyptic :series:`Pelbar Cycle` series of novels.  Like the Pelbar
  novels, I enjoyed this more for the ideas than the style.

  Apparently there is a sequel to this, `The Man from Far Cloud`,
  published in 2004.  I really ought to see about finding a copy.
