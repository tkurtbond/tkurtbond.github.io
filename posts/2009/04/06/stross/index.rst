* `Accelerando`, by Charles Stross, copyright 2005; Ace/The Berkley
  Publishing Groupo/Penguin Group (USA) Inc./Penguin Books Ltd., July
  2006; ISBN 0-441-01415-1. 

  Crash! Bang! Ouch!  The idea of sentient corporations and ponzi
  schemes taking over makes this a dystopia to me.  Very interesting,
  however; and quite dense.
