I've recently changed_ the way I build my website, from using DocBook
source and the DocBook XSL Stylesheets to convert it to HTML, over to
reStructuredText source and Sphinx_ to convert it over to HTML.
:app:`Sphinx` is much faster and less resource intensive for the
way I build my website, and is more reliable about noticing when
things have changed than my old hacked up :app:`cook`\- or
:app:`make`\-based build systems.  Since updating the site is now much
easier I'm much more likely to actually do so.

.. _website: http://consp.org/~tkb
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

.. I left the consp.org address in for the wayback machine.
   2024-02-14: took out the ~/tkb address because google search
   console complains.
