I've recently changed_ the way I build my website_, from using DocBook
source and the DocBook XSL Stylesheets to convert it to HTML, over to
reStructuredText source and Sphinx_ to convert it over to HTML.
:program:`Sphinx` is much faster and less resource intensive for the
way I build my website, and is more reliable about noticing when
things have changed than my old hacked up :program:`cook`\- or
:program:`make`\-based build systems.  Since updating the site is now much
easier I'm much more likely to actually do so.
