   Goblin Warrens`, from the blog `A Rust Monster Ate My Sword`_,
   which can be found as part of `The One Page Dungeon Codex 2009`_.
   If you haven't played that you might want to skip this entry.

Attending
=========

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord
+ M.A., playing Niall, a cleric
+ L.B., playing Caramel, a halfling
+ T.A., playing Angrim, and Elf

Overview
========

This was another short session, and since one of the regular players
was missing (E.A.) I decided to run something other than B2.

Attempt #1
==========

S, SE branch, to room **S**, attacked by Living Statues.  Eventually
fled, jumping and pulling Caramel up, and back to town.

Attempt #2
==========

S, W to S, to **G**, when attacked retreated to passage, then ran
through to SW branch, killed 2 goblins, then killed the 2 goblins from
other side who came up behind.  **Loot**: 14 cp, 9 cp, 12 cp, 4 maces,
2 crossbows, 4 scale armor.
