* `Saturn's Children`, :subtitle:`A Space Opera` by Charles Stross,
  copyright 2008; Ace Books/The Berkley Publishing Group/The Penguin
  Group/Penguin Group (USA) Inc., July 2008; ISBN 978-0-441-01594-8.
  Bridgeport Public Library.

  Despite the cover (which I suppose was appropriate to the content of
  the book, but still was rather off-putting) I enjoyed this.
