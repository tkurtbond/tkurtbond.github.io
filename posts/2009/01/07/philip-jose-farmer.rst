+ `The Dark Heart of Time`, by Philip José Farmer, copyright © 1999 by
  Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.; Del Rey/The Ballantine Publishing
  Group/Random House, Inc.; 1st edition, 1st printing, June 1999; ISBN
  0-345-42463-8.

  It's been a while since I've read any of Burrough's :series:`Tarzan`
  books, so I can't compare styles, but certainly in inventiveness and
  subject matter Farmer did a good job with this story.  I've always
  been fond of Farmer's various different takes on Tarzan, whether an
  authorized pastiche like this one, a deconstruction, an alternate
  mythology, or a backstory element [#hadon-fn]_.

  I really should complete my collection of Tarzan novels, though.
