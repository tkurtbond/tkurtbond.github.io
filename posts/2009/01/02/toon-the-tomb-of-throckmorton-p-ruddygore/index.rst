So, one of the things L.B. really wanted to do this winter vacation
was play |Toon|_ with the kids_.  Unfortunately, since I'd been so bad
about getting things prepared and even worse getting things scheduled,
we almost didn't get to play.  We did get to play a short |Toon|
session, though, while visiting C.P.B., my older brother, and his
family. 

The roster was:

* L.B., I think playing a chocolate loving bear
* C.P.B. and M.B., playing an elf named Ralph
* D.B., playing a hovering suit of plate armor

|Toon|, as an inherently comic game, is hard for me to prepare and run.
Luckily, it has a very useful “Adventure Generator”, and I had used it
earlier to get some general ideas, and I wrote a few paragraphs in my
notebook about them and picked and adapted some characters from the many
NPCs in the |Toon| rulebook.  When we finally got around to playing we
didn't have time to create new PCs, so I just passed out some old
character sheets, and they all picked toons they'd created in earlier
sessions, and away we went.  I pretty much improvised on the stuff
from my notebooks, and the kids seemed to have fun.
