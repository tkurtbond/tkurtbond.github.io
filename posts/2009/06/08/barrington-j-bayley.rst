* `The Soul of the Robot`, by Barrington J. Baley, copyright 1974;
  Condor, March 1978; published by arrangment with Doubleday &
  Company, Inc;  ISBN 0-895160161-1.

  I ran across this book as a child, in a local library.  It was
  shelved in the children's section, which, considering some of the
  content, was probably a mistake.  In any case, it was one of the
  formative science fiction novels of my childhood.

  Recently I found out that there was a *sequel* to this, published
  many years afterward, and bought a copy.
