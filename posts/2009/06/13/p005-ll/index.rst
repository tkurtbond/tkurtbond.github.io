   We're playing *B2 â€” Keep on the Borderland*, so if you haven't
   played that you might want to skip this entry.

I got to run another Labyrinth Lord session for the kids_.

Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.
+ M.A., playing *James the Cleric* and *Jeffrey the Monk*.
+ T.A., playing *Glen the Strategist* (a wizard) and *Dooley the sly* (a thief).
+ E.A., playing *Curufin the Elf* and *Drusilla the Ranger*.
+ L.B., playing *Taffy the Halfling* and *Alice the Cleric*.

Kobolds are Sneaky
==================

They decided to try the kobolds that surprised them on one of their
earlier trips.   Luckily the kobolds weren't in the tree branches this
time, so they went down the tunnel.  Unfortunately, Dooley fell in the
pit trap.  James pulled him out with his belt (since they didn't have
any rope or pole).  The guards attached them with ranged weapons, and
the party fled the kobold warren.  Once outside the stopped for a
moment, but giant rats boiled out of the tunnel, soon followed by
kobolds.  Eventually the group managed to defeat the rats and the
kobolds, but in the process Dooley was overcome by the rats, and lay
unconscious while they chewed on his face.  His comrades healed him as
well as they could, but he was horribly scarred and lost two fingers
from his left hand.
