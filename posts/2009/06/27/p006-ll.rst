   We're playing *B2 â€” Keep on the Borderland*, so if you haven't
   played that you might want to skip this entry.

I got to run another Labyrinth Lord session for the kids_.

Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.
+ M.A., playing *James the Cleric* and *Jeffrey the Monk*.
+ T.A., playing *Glen the Strategist* (a wizard) and *Dooley the sly* (a thief).
+ E.A., playing *Curufin the Elf* and *Drusilla the Ranger*.
+ L.B., playing *Taffy the Halfling* and *Alice the Cleric*.

Kobolds are Stubborn
====================

The group spent most of their loot on a high level cleric who fixed
Dooley up, even regenerating his fingers.  Dooley now is a bit more
rough-hewn, but not really any uglier than he was originally.

Out for revenge, they went back and went after the kobolds.  This time
they got past the pit trapped and killed lots of kobolds, but were run
off again.  Dru and Dooley were both dying when their friends dragged
them out and healed them, but the kobolds were in no shape to pursue
them.
