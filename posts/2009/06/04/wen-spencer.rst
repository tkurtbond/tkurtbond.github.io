* `Endless Blue`, by Wen Spencer, copyright 2007; A Baen Books
  Original/Baen Publishing Enterprises; June 2009; ISBN:
  978-1-4391-3271-5.

  Starts very much *in medias res*.  Interesting.  Mentions two other
  Baen books by Wen Spencer: 

  - `Tinker`
  - `Wolf Who Rules`

  Have to look them up.
