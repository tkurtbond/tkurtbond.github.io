   We're playing *B2 â€” Keep on the Borderland*, so if you haven't
   played that you might want to skip this entry.

I got to run another Labyrinth Lord session for the kids_.

Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:

+ T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.
+ M.A., playing *James the Cleric* and *Jeffrey the Monk*.
+ T.A., playing *Glen the Strategist* (a wizard) and *Dooley the sly* (a thief).
+ E.A., playing *Curufin the Elf* and *Drusilla the Ranger*.
+ L.B., playing *Taffy the Halfling* and *Alice the Cleric*.

Kobolds are Dead
================

Still out for revenge, they went after the kobolds again, but set off
the alarm bell, and ran back to town.  They came back on the second
day and were attacked by female kobolds in the tree, who were joined
by six more from inside the kobold warren, but the day went to the
adventurers, who wiped the kobolds out, and proceeded to clean out the
kobold warren as well.
