* `The Wizard Hunters`, by Martha Wells, copyright 2003;
  Eos/HarperCollinsPublishers [#]_, First Eos paperback printing June
  2004; 2nd printing; ISBN 0-380-80798-X.

  This series has become one of my favorites, for what are probably very
  idiosyncratic reasons.

.. [#] I hate companies that use StUd__\ LyCaPs__ for company names.
