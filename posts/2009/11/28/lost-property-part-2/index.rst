Attending
=========

Clockwise, starting with the GM:

* T.K.B. — GM
* E.A. — Aspen Thistledown & Sigisund Thorinsson
* T.A. — Sir Deelan the Ignoble & Belinda Warmhearted
* M.A. — Alfros Bladesinger
* L.B. — Sir Leopold Drakehelm & Cassandra Lightfinger

Unfortunately, D.B. wasn't available.

L.B. had been dissatisfied with the character she had been playing,
Belinda Warmhearted (a pacifist with a low Fighting skill), and
switched her for Sir Leopold Drakehelm.

She and E.A. both wanted to try playing two characters.

Actual Play, Afternoon
======================

As they rested, they heard noises approaching from the unblocked side
of the tunnel, and prepared for battle, but it turned out to be the
remains of another group the criminal syndicate had sent to find Jeck
Lightfinger, Sigisund Thorinsson and Cassandra Lightfinger.  They
gladly joined forces against the ghouls of the tunnels.

After resting, Aspen Thistledown was able to track her way back to
where they had left the tracks of the dragged body.  Once there she
had no difficulty tracking them to the ghoul's feasting room, where
they found many bodies in the various stages of decay, including that
of Jeck Lightfinger.  Unfortunately, the item they sought was not on
what little remained of the body.  Search the room, they noticed that
many of the corpses showed the signs of having died from the blood
plague, which lead them to the thought that someone had broken into
the burial tunnels where the plague bodies had been interred.  They
hurriedly left the ghoul tunnels and headed back to report.

    ▶ Here we broke for supper.

Actual Play, Evening
====================

    ▶ After supper we picked up again. 

The criminal syndicate gave them all medallions to protect them from
the blood plague and sent them off to the plague burial tunnels.  They
found that the seal on the door to the tunnels had been broken, and
someone had been coming and going.  They spent some time exploring the
tunnels, and eventually came to area where another had broken into
the plague tunnels, coming from further in the mountain.  They
followed this tunnel until they heard chanting from ahead.  Sneaking
up, they found an ancient temple carved into the mountain, with rat men
chanting and praying.

The kids knew that they needed a plan, or they'd get wiped out by the
rat men, but it took them a little while to agree on one.  They
decided to sneak onto one of the balconies that ran along the sides of
the temple, so that they could only be attacked through two places,
the hallway leading to the balcony from the tunnel at the back of the
temple and the stairs leading up to the balcony at the front of the
temple.  They positioned their ranged fighters to target the rat man
shaman leading the chant, their melee fighters to hold the entrances,
and started off their attack with Alfros Bladesinger casting *fear* on
the area with the greatest number of rat men.

It was a good plan, and it worked out well for them.  The *fear* spell
drove away many of the rat men, back into their tunnels deeper into
the depths.  They managed to Shake the shaman, and keep him Shaken
most of the time.  The melee fighters kept the other rat men off
the ranged fighters long enough for the ranged fighters to finish
off the shaman and dispose of several of the other rat men, and they
the finished off the rest as they came up the stairs and down the
hallway. 

They searched the shaman and found the item they were looking for, so
they left to report.

Reflections
===========

I really need to start a regular Savage Worlds campaign for the kids.
