Attending
=========

Clockwise round the table, starting with the DM at 12 o'clock:

+ M.A.F. as DM
+ P.D.F. playing Kelvish, the arrogant Eladrin wizard, and acting as scribe.
+ T.K.B. playing Grimnir, the reckless dwarf fighter.
+ B.MC. playing Wrathgar, the dragonborn paladin.
+ C.A.H. playing Angore, the indispensable human **[Â¿is that right?]** cleric. 

J.H. was unable to attend, alas.


Introduction
============

Since J.H. was unable to attend, and our regular campaign was at a
point where all the characters needed to be there, we switched and
played an alternate game, starting with the adventure from the 4e `D&D
Roleplaying Game Starter Set`__.

Actual Play
===========

Encounter 1: killed 2 goblins: 2 black blades. 10 cp, 40 gp.  Found
map of village (Harken) with Cliff's Brewery circled.

Encounter 2: killed 2 fire beetles and several goblins, spent most of
our time in a cloud, wedged the door shut, and fled.

Interlude: Got the villagers all set up in the rundown stockade, ready
for the goblin assault.  Bad guys left during the night.

Encounter 3: Loot the ancient evil tomb!  Jar of healing potions, 5
doses.  Long sword +1, evil.  Studded, ceremonial high priest of demon. 

Aftermath
=========

In after game discussion we decided that, although most of the
concerns we'd had about 4e were valid, we still had fun, and would
look forward to continuing this as a campaign when our regular 3.5 D&D
campaign couldn't run.

We each got **+800 XP**.
