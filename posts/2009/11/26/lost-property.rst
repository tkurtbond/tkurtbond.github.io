   Lost Property, Triple Ace Games

Late in the afternoon the kids wanted to play an RPG again, so I
pulled out one of `Triple Ace Games`_'s `Ace Tales`_, `Lost
Property`_.  TAG's Ace Tales are their equivalent of PEG_'s `One Sheet
Adventures`: a short adventure in PDF that fits on the front and back
of one sheet, often with accompanying pre-generated characters.
This particular one is a generic fantasy adventure that has the
players working for a criminal syndicate trying to recover an item.

There weren't any pregens for this particular Ace Tale, so I got the
ones__ from PEG's `Wizards & Warriors Genre Supplement` and the ones
from `Against the Orcs` and let the players choose which they wanted.
T.B. brought along a fantasy character he had created, a noble, and
D.B. chose Sir Leopold Drakehelm, so we had two nobles working for a
criminal syndicate, so I decided that they had to be disgraced
nobles.

Actual Play
===========

An unsanctioned thief, Jeck Lightfinger, had fled with his ill-gotten
gains into **The Widow's Hold**, a local haunted house.  The
characters were charged with finding Jeck.

They entered the ill-omened house and soon found the entrance to the
tunnels below.  They were soon ambushed by ghouls (in this scenario a
type of undead), but fought them off.  When the last ghoul fled, Sir
Leopald 

.. [1] The character T.A. brought was a noble with the tag “The
   Brave”, but since they were working for a criminal syndicate he had
   to be disgraced noble and hence had the tag “The Ignoble” was more
   appropriate.  I assured T.A. that Sir Deelan the Ignoble was just
   an ignoble alternate version of Sir Deelan the Brave, and he could
   play the original character in another game.
