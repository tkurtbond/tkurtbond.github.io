L.B. decided she wanted to play Toon_ so much that she was willing to
be the Animator and run the game for `the kids`_; She came up the
idea of a holiday-themed adventure and pre-generated characters, and I
helped her with some of the game system details.  She came up with a
scenario: a premise, a list of locations, and obstacles at each.

Attending
---------

Clockwise starting with the Animator:

* L.B. — the Animator
* E.A. — Rachel Rabbit
* M.A. — Pete Pig
* T.A. — Chris the Chicken
* T.K.B. & D.B. — Pat the Pilgrim

Actual Play
-----------

E.A., M.A., and T.A. came over to play Thanksgiving morning to play
before heading next door to the holiday meal at Grandma's.

Not long after we started D.B. arrived, looking for his cousins, and
since we were playing, I bowed out and handed Pat the Pilgrim over to
Dan. 

The kids all seemed to be having fun, and L.B. said she enjoyed
running the game, although she did say that playing was more fun.
