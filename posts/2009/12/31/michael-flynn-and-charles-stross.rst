* `The January Dancer` (sp?), by Michael Flynn.

  I liked this, although I'd early put down another Flynn novel that I
  didn't like well enough to finish.

* `Iron Sunrise`, by Charles Stross.

  I liked this one too.  I'm going back and reading some of Stross's
  work that I missed when it first came out.
