  Another enjoyable entry in Stross's alternate universes series.

+ `The Steel Remains`, copyright 2009 by Richard Morgan; Ballantine

  978-0-345-49303-3.

  An interesting non-{extruded fantasy product} fantasy.
  
+ `The Draco Tavern`, copyright 2006 by Larry Niven; Tor/Tom Doherty
  Associates, LLc; 1st edition January 2006; ISBN 0-765-30863.

  Somehow I completely missed all of the series:`Draco Tavern` stories
  until reading this compilation.  Niven is still one of my favorite
  science fiction authors, and I enjoyed these tremendously.

  Berkley Publishing Group/Penguin Group (USA) Inc/Penguin Books Ltd; 
  Ace mass-market edition March 2009; ISBN 978-0-441-01691-4.

  I found the main character of this supernatural adventure
  interesting, but also annoying at times.
