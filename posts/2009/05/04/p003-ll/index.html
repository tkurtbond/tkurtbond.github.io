<h2>Manual Labor &amp; Shopping</h2>
<p>Last session they'd been captured by goblins who stripped them of all
their equipment and most of their clothing, but did accept a ransom
offer.</p>
<p>Following up T.A.'s suggestion last session that they look for work, I
decided they would stay around the keep for a while and try and find
work, so they could get enough money to buy some new equipment.  They
found some work as guards, some work digging sewers for the keep, and
some random odd jobs around the keep.</p>
<p>T.A. suggested that they'd have probably cached the hides from the
three deer Drusilla killed the week they were camping, so that they
could pick them up on the way back.  I allowed that it was a likely
thing for them to have done.  Then T.A suggested they'd probably have
cached the 6 shortswords from orcs they killed, and I allowed that it
was a reasonable thing for them to have done.  Then T.A. suggested
that they'd cached the money they were carrying, and I said no way, no
how.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a month of work, they pooled their money and figured out
that each person had about 25 gp to buy equipment.  James sold the
shortsword and 2 javelins he got as loot.  Jeffrey sold the javelins,
but kept the shortsword.  Glen sold the shortsword and javelins as
well.  The others kept them, so they didn't have to buy a weapon.
After this the players worked at reequipping themselves.  At first
they didn't think they'd be able to afford any armor better than
padded, but by cutting down their lists and the non-armor-wearing
characters loaning the other characters a little bit of money, they
ended up being able to afford leather armor, and slings and sling
bullets for ranged weapons. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#slings" id="id1">1</a> Eventually <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#herding-cats" id="id2">2</a> they
were all outfitted, and ready to go.</p>

<div class="section" id="oops-take-2">
<h2>Oops, Take 2!</h2>
<p>So, they set out east and then north along the road leading into the
borderlands.  When they got to the area of the road nearest the valley
where they'd found the goblins, they again left the road and pushed
their way through the thick undergrowth of the forest until they
reached the semi-clear valley.  This time they decided to explore the
<em>other</em> side of the valley, climbing up the hill above the first
thicket in the valley.  There they found another cave entrance.
Having learned from their mistake last time, they decided to try
stealth.  The three that had <em class="skill">Move Silently</em>, Jeffry the Monk,
Dooley the Sly, and Drusilla the Ranger, would try to sneak in, while
the other three would wait at the cave mouth for a yell.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dooley and Drusilla made a lot of noise as they went
in, so they motioned for the others to follow them in.  The first
thing they saw, in the light of their torches, was a section of wall
covered with niches, which all contained severed heads in various
stages of decomposition.  Fearing for their lives, they immediately
ran out of the cave and Dooley, looking for somewhere to hide, lead
them further into the valley, downhill slightly, to another large
thicket.</p>
<p>As they rushed into the thicket, through the heavy bushes at the
outside into the lighter undergrowth of the inside, they noticed it
concealed, at its lowest point, just above where it edged onto the
flat valley floor, another cave entrance.  Then they noticed the
kobolds in the tree throwing javelins down at them.  Before they got
out of the thicket they had two men down, Dooley and Jeffry.  Once out
of the thicket they ran full speed for the road, only to see that orcs
had come out of the <em>first</em> cave mouth, and were throwing javelins, as
well as the kobolds on the edge of the thicket throwing another round
of javelins.  Luckily, nobody else was downed, and they saw the orcs
and kobolds laughing at them as they vanished into the brush.</p>
<p>They made it to the road, and not hearing any immediate pursuit,
stopped to let James cast <em class="spell">Cure Light Wounds</em> on Jeffry, the
worst hurt, and luckily M.A. rolled pretty well, healing enough of
Jeffry's wounds so that he was conscious and able to get up.  At the
same time Drusilla attempted to bind Dooley's wounds to keep him
from bleeding to death.  Drusilla succeeded, so Dooley stabilized.
And that's were we left them.</p>

<p>I've always thought that D&amp;D nerfed slings, so I ruled
that if they used stones they gathered the slings did the stated
<strong class="dice">d4</strong> damage, but that if they bought lead sling bullets the
slings would do <strong class="dice">d6</strong> damage.</p>

<p>They're good kids, but even good kids, at their
ages, tend to get distracted and bicker, and so things took longer
than I'd hoped.</p>
