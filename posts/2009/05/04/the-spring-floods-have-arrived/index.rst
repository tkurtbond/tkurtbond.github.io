Well, the spring floods have arrived.  This morning when I went out to
drive to work there was water over Jesse Run Road at the mouth of Clay
Lick, a few hundred feet east from my driveway.  As I drove west down
Jesse Run Road, I could see water was over the Co Hwy 8/4, which leads
to Stretch Run, another alternate route off Jesse Run.  When I got to
the end of Jesse Run Road, water was up over the road, at least a foot
deep.  I pulled off the road to turn around, but got too far off and
got stuck in a little ditch.  Luckily the folks who live at the end of
Jesse Run, and a couple of other motorists came over and pushed me
out.  So, I'm back a home now, and it doesn't look like I'll be going
anywhere for a while.
