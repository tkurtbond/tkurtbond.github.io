<h2>Attending</h2>
<p>Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.</p></li>
<li><p>M.A., playing <em>James the Cleric</em> and <em>Jeffrey the Monk</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>T.A., playing <em>Glen the Strategist</em> (a wizard) and <em>Dooley the sly</em> (a thief).</p></li>
<li><p>E.A., playing <em>Curufin the Elf</em> and <em>Drusilla the Ranger</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="camping">
<h2>Camping</h2>
<p>Since everyone (pretty much) had been wounded, the characters spent 7
days camping and getting <em class="spell">Cure Light Wounds</em> cast on them by
James.  Drusilla spent the days hunting in the nearby forest, and kept
them feed reasonably well, although there were a couple of hungry
days.</p>
<p>By the 7<sup>th</sup> day the orcs started to stink, so they buried
them, still in their leather armor.  After they buried them they
realized they could have sold the armor, but after several days of
decomposition the armor was probably not salable any more.</p>
<p>They divided the coin up, with 10 sp each, with 4 left over for the
party treasury.  Glen paid his 10 sp immediately to Dooley, which
after the interest left him still 12.5 sp in debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oops">
<h2>Oops!</h2>
<p>On the eight day they continued north along the road that lead into
the borderlands.  Before the valley closed in, they could see the
outline of the hills under the trees curving in sharply on the west,
while the east side continued straight and steep.  As they walked
along the narrow valley, Drusilla noticed some light tracks leading
into the thick forest to the west, although she couldn't tell what had
made the tracks.  They decided to follow the tracks through the
forest.  After a lot of bending and crawling and scraping through the
thick undergrowth they emerged in a small, partially forested valley.
One of the first things that they saw was a cave opening on the south
side of the valley.  Whooping and hollering they headed straight for
the cave.  They'd only gotten 30 feet in and had noticed that the
original cave had been turned into tunnels carved from the rock, when
they ran into a group of goblins, who yelled <strong>“Bree-Yark!”</strong> and
attacked.  The characters, though several had been injured, were doing
pretty well, having killed 5 of the 6 goblins, when two more groups of
6 goblins appeared, one in front and another behind, an they heard
something <em>big</em> stopping its way down the corridor toward them.  The
new goblins all threw javelins, and by the end of the round Glen and
Dooley were on the ground dying, and the rest of adventurers were
severely wounded, though still standing.  And that's when the ogre
arrived, stomping down the corridor.  With the goblins behind them
blocking their way out, things were looking grim.</p>
<p>At this point I suggested to the <a class="reference external" href="../../../../../categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> that perhaps surrender would be
a good idea, if the goblins thought the adventurers could be ransomed.
Luckily, Curufin knew how to speak goblin, an quickly offered
surrender and ransom, which the goblins accepted.  They quickly
stripped and tied the adventurers and negotiated a 10 gp ransom each,
to be paid no later than 2 days from now.</p>
<p>The PCs picked Jeffry to go back to town and get the ransom, as he
actually had enough to ransom everybody <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#kindness" id="id1">1</a>, and although he had a close
call on the way back, having to hide from a group of orcs out looking
for something, he managed to get back in time, and the goblins kept
their word and released the adventurers, wearing nothing but
breech-clouts.</p>
<p>The adventurers hurried back to the Keep to regroup.  They expected
the townsfolk to be mad that they'd stirred up the monsters, but the
townsfolk said that the monsters had been killing people already, and
at least the adventurers had killed some of the monsters.  The
townsfolk did suggest the adventurers should be a <em>little</em> more
careful next time.</p>
<p>So, the adventurers are safe, but they've lost most of their money,
all of their equipment, and somehow have to reequip.  T.A. suggested
they look for work around the Keep to help get money for new
equipment.  And that's where we left them.</p>

<p>I kindly told the players that they'd left any gold
they had back in the Keep in a bank.</p>
