+ `The Breaking of Northwall`, by Paul O. Williams, copyright 1981;
  Del Rey/Ballantine Books, First Edition February 1981, Fifth
  Printing October 1984; ISBN 0-345-32434-X.  Cover art by Darrel
  K\. Sweet, Map by Chris Barbieri.  Book One of :series:`The Pelbar
  Cycle`.

  Back in the eighties, when these were first published, I read the
  second book of :series:`The Pelbar Cycle` before I read this, the
  first book, and I remember it was a little bit hearing legends in
  the second book, and then getting to meet some of the legends in the
  first book.

  I like books these for the interesting post apocalypse societies.
