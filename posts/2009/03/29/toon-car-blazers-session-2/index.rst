On Sunday the kids came over after lunch to play Toon_ again.

.. admonition:: Spoilers!

   “Car Blazers”, *Toon*, `Steve Jackson Games`_

Attending
---------

* T.A. played Nektar
* E.A. played Betheny
* L.B. played Erica
* M.A. played Gorge (pronounced “George”)

Actual Play
-----------

The characters followed the Teleks to the *Tooth Decay*, where Nektar
kept trying to keep them away from the ship.  Luckily by the time the
others caught on they were too close and got snagged by the arm.
Inside they wasted no time aggravating Bob, so when Torgo told them
he'd be sending troops to imprison them Bob dumped them out of the
*Tomato* and told them they were contractually obligated to foil
Torgo's fiendish plans.  They went out into the corridor and were
immediately run over by the robot car carrying fruits, and were
riding it back to the source when a ragged dentist spotted them and
jumped and grabbed Bethany off Erica's back, tucking and rolling into
a nearby bubble.  The others followed quickly, and soon everyone found
themshelves the targets of primitive dentists.  At one point everybody
was being dragged by one or more dentist toward dilapidated dentist
chairs of one unpleasant sort or another, but in the end only Betheny
ended up in a chair and had her teeth drilled — after being
anesthetized, of course!  It was at this point that a terrible noise
was heard in the distance and the dentists and their chairs and even
some of the trees ran off.

And that's where we left them for the time being.

Aftermath
---------

As usual I found *Toon* to be very tiring to run, but worth it.
