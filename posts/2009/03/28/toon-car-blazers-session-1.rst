   “Car Blazers”, *Toon*, `Steve Jackson Games`_

L.B. *really* wanted to play Toon_ again, but I wanted to try
something different from the one-shots we'd been doing, so I looked
through the rulebook and found a cartoon series that looked fun: “Car
Blazers!”.

Character Creation
------------------

For some reason Toon and Buggin' are the games we've done 
character creation in the most.  (For the `Savage Worlds`_ games I've
been letting them choose from pregenerated characters, probably
because most of them have been one-shots.)

We spent most of the evening doing character creation, and
everybody ended up with neat characters.


* T.A. created Nektar, a three foot tall blue alien with golden eyes
  and antennae like Shrek's who was kidnapped and forced to join the
  Car Blazers and who just wants to escape.

* E.A. created Betheny, a 2 inch tall mini-me with wings who always has
  to be in the middle of things and joined the Car Blazers because she
  didn't like the orphanage, and who with a Muscle of 3 ended up the
  strongest character!

* L.B. created Erica, a bunny with a jetpack who was in it for the
  carrots, belives everybody should have a special blankie, and who
  has the urge to defeat villans and protect friends and their
  possessions.

* M.A. created Gorge (pronounced “George”), an alien from the sun, a
  humanoid solar flare with a belt with two holsters and flame guns
  who joined the Car Blazers to get to burn things.

E.A. started the orphanage idea, and when every single last one of
them rolled a 3+6=9 for Hit Points, I decided that they must have all
been orphans from different orphanages that the routine medical workup
on joining the Car Blazers proved conclusively that they were
quadruplets separated at birth!

I got the kids to laugh uproariously even before character generation
was over.  E.A. kept going on about how horrible the orphanage had
been, and everytime she did an orphanage matron would pop out of
nowhere, show evidence that the orphanage had actually been a great
place, and then disappear.  E.A. kept making up things that were more
and more difficult to disprove, and the orphanage matron would go to
more and more absurd lengths to disprove them, pulling the younger
Betheny out of pictures of luxury and comparing DNA from her blood to
that of the older Betheny, etc.   This was really fun, and helped keep
character generation from dragging too much.

T.A., an alien, wanted to make sure that the Car Blazers' unbreakable 5-year
contract used normal-length years — which made me laugh sinisterly.


Actual Play
-----------

After character creation we only had 45 minutes to play, but we went
ahead and started on the “Car Blazers” Series Pilot.  They got
introduced to the Teleks and eventually blew two of their battleships
to pieces, and then spotted two other Telek ships leaving the system,
and that's where we left them for that evening.
