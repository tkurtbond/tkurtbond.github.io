* `The Black Tower`, by Louis Bayard; William Morrow, 2008.

* `The Cardinal's Heir`, by Jaki Demarest; Medallion Press, 2004.

* `Hellboy: Oddest Jobs`, edited by Christopher Golden, illustrated by
  Mike Mignola.

  I suppose it's odd that I've still not read more than one or two
  Hellboy comics.  I really ought to get some of the compilations.

* `The Fox`, by Sherwood Smith; DAW Books/Penguin Group; 2007.
  Sequel to `Inda`.
