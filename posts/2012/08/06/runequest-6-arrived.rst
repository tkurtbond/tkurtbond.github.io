My copy of `RuneQuest 6` by Nash, Whitaker, & Friends at `The Design
Mechanism`__ arrived today. (2020-03-04 Update: This RPG is now known
as `Mythras`.)

It is a nice big paperback book.  I've had time to scan it quickly and
incompletely.  I like the cover, with its nod to the Chaosium
`RuneQuest` cover.  I like the layout and typography.  I like the
layout.  It looks very complete.  It looks a bit more complex than
my current taste.

This might be the ideal d100 variant for folks wanting more
complexity, and OpenQuest_ the variant for folks wanting less
complexity, and Chaosium_\ 's `Basic Roleplaying`_ for folks wanting a
multi-genre system.
