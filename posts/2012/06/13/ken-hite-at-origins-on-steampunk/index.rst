`Lewis Pulsipher`__ said in his post `Origins 2012 — “Diminished”`__:

    I asked if Hite was familiar enough with Steampunk to say what the
    story is in that (to me) obscure genre.  He pointed out that it’s
    now more an aesthetic than a genre, the goggles and leather and
    glass and so forth (and corsets for women?).  Yet he then made an
    erudite comparison, saying that just as fairy stories helped
    Victorians reconcile with what was a pretty ugly past (and where
    the real fairy stories were “don’t go out on the moor at night or
    they’ll eat you”), steampunk helps people reconcile with
    technology.  Modern technology is a “black box” to most people,
    but most people can understand that hot steam expands and can move
    things, and feel comfortable with the steam engines and
    “clockwork” of Steampunk.  Steampunk helps people come to terms
    with technology.  A remarkable answer.
