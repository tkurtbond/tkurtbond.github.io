* From the series `The Iron Seas`:series:\ :

  + `The Iron Duke`, by Meljean Brook; copyright 2010 by Melissa Kahn;
    ISBN 978-0-425-23667-3.

  + `Heart of Steel`, by Meljean Brook; copyright 2011 by Melissa
    Kahn; ISB 978-0-425-24330-5.

    From the front cover: «“Meljean Brook has brilliantly defined the
    new genre of steampunk romance.” — Jayne Ann Krentz, `New York
    Times` bestselling author».

  These are very good.  The back covers list them as “paranormal
  romance” [#pr-section]_, but I suspect that they form exemplars for
  a new genre.

  Her setting is interestingly and greatly altered history.

  Stories by Meljean Brook appear in (at least) the following
  anthologies: `Hot Spell`, `Wild Thing`, `First Blood`, `Must
  Love Hellhounds`, `Burning Up`, and `Angels of Darkness`.

  ..
     Explicit sex.

.. [#pr-section] The local library I frequent most often has a
   separate section for paranormal romance now, though these were
   shelved in general fiction.
