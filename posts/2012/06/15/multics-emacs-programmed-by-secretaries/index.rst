RMS relates_ how programming Multics Emacs was so convenient that secretaries started to learn to use it:

    … The language that you build your extensions on shouldn't be
    thought of as a programming language in afterthought; it should be
    designed as a programming language. In fact, we discovered that
    the best programming language for that purpose was Lisp.

    It was Bernie Greenberg, who discovered that it was (5). He wrote
    a version of Emacs in Multics MacLisp, and he wrote his commands
    in MacLisp in a straightforward fashion. The editor itself was
    written entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs proved to be a great
    success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that
    even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use
    it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to
    extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So the
    secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't
    scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful
    things and they learned to program.

    So Bernie saw that an application — a program that does something
    useful for you — which has Lisp inside it and which you could
    extend by rewriting the Lisp programs, is actually a very good way
    for people to learn programming. It gives them a chance to write
    small programs that are useful for them, which in most arenas you
    can't possibly do. They can get encouragement for their own
    practical use — at the stage where it's the hardest — where they
    don't believe they can program, until they get to the point where
    they are programmers.

   Wasn't troff also used by secretaries?
