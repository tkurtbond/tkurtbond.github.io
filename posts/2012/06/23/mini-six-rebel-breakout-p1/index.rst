I ran the “Rebel Breakout” adventure from `Star Wars: the Roleplaying
Game` using `Mini Six`__ from `AntiPaladin Games`__.  `Mini Six` is a very
simple RPG derived from OpenD6 (1_, 2_, 3_, 4_, 5_), the OGL version
of the D6 roleplaying game engine that descended from the original
`Star Wars: the Roleplaying Game` from `West End Games`_.

Attending
=========

+ T.K.B. — GM.
+ T.A. — Haven Zul, a human smuggler.
+ M.A. — Milagro, a human/cyborg.
+ E.A. — J'Lee, a bounty hunter.

Actual Play
===========

J'Lee established herself early on as a cool competent bounty hunter —
even when she failed whatever she was attempting, something cool
happened.

There were a lot of broken steam and water pipes and severed power
lines dropping into multiple flooded areas expanding toward the
characters.

They finished up through :scene:`Encounter 6: Firefight`, ending the
session with electrified water chasing them down the side corridor at
:area:`A`.
