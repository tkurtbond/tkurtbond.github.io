Some people say that the popularity of the OSR is due to nostalgia.
I'm not so sure.

I started playing roleplaying games with `AD&D`, but eventually got
dissatisfied with it and moved on to other RPGs, wanting more options
and verisimilitude.  I got back into `D&D` with 3.5E, but eventually
got dissatisfied with it because of its complexity and power
creep. [#minmax]_ 

I've been enjoying `Swords & Wizardry White Box` and `Labyrinth Lord`
recently, rediscovering the things I *did* like about `AD&D` back in
the day, but also enjoying the different nature of `S&W WB` (more like
`OD&D`) and `Labyrinth Lord` (more like `Basic/Expert`) from `AD&D`,
and also liking some of the other variants, like `Lamentations of the
Flame Princess`. 

But I have absolutely no desire to pull out my `AD&D` books and play
that *exact* game.  The closest I've gotten is using the Brave
Halfling `Delving Deeper` classes in one game and the `Labyrinth Lord`
`Advanced Edition Companion` in another, and both of those are much
simpler (or at least more simply presented) than the actual `AD&D`
rules.

I think what I like about `D&D` is the simplicity of the core system — 
if I want something more complex, I'll probably go with another
system — and the original `AD&D` books are just more complicated than
I want from `D&D`.  If I was going to run an `AD&D` module, something
I'd have no hesitation to do, I might pull out OSRIC, but I might just
use `Advanced Edition Companion` and not worry about the minor
differences.   Actually, now that I think about it, I might just use
`Swords & Wizardry Complete`. 

.. [#minmax] Something about `D&D` 3E and 3.5E brings out the
   min-maxer in me as a player, and prompts me to try to build NPCs
   like I'd build PCs and creatures using the official rules, with
   feats and skills, etc., but those rules end up annoying me through
   their fiddly but ultimately restrictive nature.  It is worse than
   `BESM`, where at least the fiddly rules let you create almost
   anything.
