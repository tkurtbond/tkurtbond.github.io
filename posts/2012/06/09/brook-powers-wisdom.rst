* From the :series:`Guardian` series:

  + `Demon Night`, by Meljean Brook; copyright 2008 by Melissa Kahn;
    ISBN 978-0-425-21977-5.

  + `Demon Forged`, by Meljean Brook; copyright 2009 by Melissa Kahn;
    ISBN 978-0-425-23041-1.

  The :series:`Guardian` series consists of (at least) `Demon Angel`,
  `Demon Moon`, `Demon Night`, `Demon Bound`, and `Demon Forged`.  (I
  haven't read `Demon Bound` yet.)  Stories by Meljean Brook appear in
  (at least) the following anthologies: `Hot Spell`, `Wild Thing`,
  `First Blood`, and `Must Love Hellhounds`.

* `Hide Me Among the Graves`, by Tim Powers, copyright 2012;
  ISBN 978-0-06-123154-4.

  Excellent.  A sequel of sorts to `The Stress of Her Regard`.

* From the :series:`Hex`: series:

  + `Demons are a Girl's Best Friend`, by Linda Wisdom, copyright 2011;
    ISBN 978-1-4022-5439-0.

  + `A Demon Does it Better`, by Linda Wisdom, copyright 2012;
    ISBN 978-1-4022-3672. 

  These are farther to the romance side of the “paranormal romance”
  genre than I generally prefer.

  The earlier books in the :series:`Hex` series are `50 Ways to Hex
  Your Lover`, `Hex Appeal`, `Wicked by Any Other Name`, and `Hex in
  High Heels`.
