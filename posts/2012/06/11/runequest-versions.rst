I can never remember the publication dates of the various versions of
`RuneQuest`, so here's a list: 

* `RuneQuest` (1978), Chaosium_.  AKA RuneQuest I, RQI, RQ1.  Was set
  in the world of Glorantha.  

* `RuneQuest`, second edition (1980), Chaosium.  AKA RuneQuest II,
  RQII, RQ2.  Was set in the world of Glorantha.  

* `RuneQuest`, third edition (1984), Avalon Hill.  AKA RuneQuest III,
  RQ3.  Used Fantasy Europe as the example setting, but also had
  a lot of Glorantha publications.

  Originally published as a box set, it was republished as a paperback
  book in the US in the early 1990s during the brief but productive
  RuneQuest Renaissance ushered in by the new RuneQuest editor at
  Avalon Hill, Ken Rolston.

* `RuneQuest: Adventures in Glorantha`, (never published
  commercially), Avalon Hill.  AKA RQIV and RQ:AiG on the Internet.

* `RuneQuest` (2006), `Mongoose Publishing`_.  AKA MRQ on the Internet.

  This was published as an setting-independent fantasy system (under
  the OGL), but Mongoose also had a license to publish material about
  the “Second Age” of the world of Glorantha and published a lot of
  Glorantha specific books.

* `RuneQuest`, second edition (2010), Mongoose Publishing. AKA MRQ2 on
  the Internet.  (Mongoose called this “RuneQuest II”, and books for
  this edition usually have a RQII logo on their cover.)

* `RuneQuest`, sixth edition (announced 16 July 2011), `The Design
  Mechanism`_.

I'll not go into the related histories of the related `Basic
Roleplaying` games from Chaosium, nor the completely different system
`HeroQuest` which also used the setting of Glorantha.

For more RuneQuest history see Pete Maranci's `The History of
RuneQuest`_, and `Pete's RuneQuest & Roleplaying!`_ for more on
RuneQuest in general.

Mongoose released a new RPG, `Legend`_, using the mechanics from their
RuneQuest, second edition, under the OGL.
