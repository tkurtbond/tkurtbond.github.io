I spent some of my tax return this year on picking up some Glorantha
and RuneQuest RPG supplements, and a bunch of them came today.

* `Moon Design Publications`_

  + `Pavis: Gateway to Adventure`, by Greg Stafford and Jeff Richards.

    As a fan of the :series:`Gloranthan
    Classics` [#glorantha-classics]_ I thought Moon Design Publications
    was a natural for the Glorantha license, and I've been happy with
    all their new HeroQuest books.  I've been looking forward to their
    take on Pavis.

    This is a *big* book, 416 pages.  I like the art, some of which I
    recognize from earlier products, but there is lots of new art too.
    I like the layout and typography, generally speaking.  Lots of
    neat looking stuff.

* `Mongoose Publishing`_

  + Glorantha

    - `Glorantha: The Second Age`, the MRQ2 [#mrq2]_ core rulebook for
      Glorantha.

    - `Cults of Glorantha`

    - `Pavis Rises`

    - `Races of Glorantha, Volume 1`

    - `The Abiding Book`

  + Elric (MRQ2)

    - `Elric of Melnibone`, the MRQ2 core rulebook for Elric.

    - `Cults of the Young Kingdoms`
    
  + RuneQuest II

    - `Arms and Equipment`

    - `Empires`

    - `Vikings`



.. [#glorantha-classics]
   The :series:`Glorantha Classics` series republished a bunch of the
   Glorantha material from the original Chaosium_ RuneQuest run, and
   was a nice alternative to picking up the rather expensive original
   versions.  The :series:`Glorantha Classics` are mostly out of print
   again, but they are available in PDF form from DrivethruStuff_.

.. [#mrq2]
   Mongoose marked the books for the second edition of their
   `RuneQuest` as “RQII”, but I've seen that abbreviation used online
   for  Chaosium's  second edition of `RuneQuest`, from 1980, which is
   often referred to online as “RQ2”.  I usually refer to Mongoose's
   second edition as “MRQ2” to mark it unambiguously.
