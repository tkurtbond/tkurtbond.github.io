My `print copy`_ of the `Savage Worlds`_ plot point campaign book `The Last
Sons`_ for Deadlands_ from `Pinnacle Entertainment Group`_ that I preordered months ago arrived today.

It is a large, heavy, beautiful book, and from my quick look it is
full of interesting, useful stuff.

And everything that `Studio 2`_ ships is always very well packaged.
This book was sealed in a bubble-wrap envelope, surrounded by loose
foam peanuts, all in a box of extra-thick cardboard.
