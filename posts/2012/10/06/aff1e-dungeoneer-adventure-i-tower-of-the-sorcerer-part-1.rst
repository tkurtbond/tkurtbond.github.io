   We're playing “Dungeoneer Adventure I: Tower of the Sorcerer”, from
   `Dungeoneer`, so if you haven't played that you might want to skip
   this entry.

As I've mentioned before_ I've been trying to use the RPGs derived
from the `Fighting Fantasy` gamebooks for pickup games with the kids_.
This time around I switched from `Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory
Role-playing Game`__ (`FF:TIRpG`) to Dungeoneer, the first book of `Advanced
Fighting Fantasy`__ (`AFF1e`), and started “Dungeoneer Adventure I: Tower of the
Sorcerer”, the first introductory scenario in the book, using the
pre-generated characters from the book.

I wanted to get L.B. in the game through Google Hangouts, but
unfortunately the scheduling didn't work out.  She did pick a
character, Alex Wolfric, and I turned modified the character sheet
turning the character in Alexa Wolfrica.

Attending
=========

Clockwise, starting with the Director:

+ T.K.B. — Director

+ T.A. — Grimbold Tornhelm

+ M.A. — Gordo Brondwyn

+ E.A. — Aspen Darkfire; she also played Alexa Wolfrica, L.B.'s
  character, since L.B. couldn't attend

Actual Play
===========

Previously
----------

On the occasion that the kids picked out their characters from the
pre-gens I ran a combat between Gordo Brondwyn and Grimbold Tornhelm
so they could see how combat and skills worked.  Gordo threw daggers
at Grimbold and kept out of his reach, but didn't have much recourse
once he'd thrown all his daggers.  I stopped the combat there.

More Rules Familiarization
--------------------------

We started out with some combat with Aspen Darkfire and Alexa Wolfrica
versus Gordo Brondwyn, so E.A. could see how combat and surprise
rounds worked, and how spells worked, since she was the only player
who would be running spellcasters this episode, and everybody could
see how combat between one character on one side and multiple
characters on the other side worked.

Then I had them do some tunnel exploring under an abandoned temple to
show them how some of the other Special Skills worked, including
:ss:`Trap Sense`, :ss:`Underground Lore`, :ss:`Dark Sense`, and
:ss:`Awareness`.  There were pressure plates, a rolling boulder (ala
Indiana Jones), and a chasm across the tunnel that the boulder herded
them toward.  Aspen and Alexa both noticed the chasm, but Gordo and
Grimbold, behind them, did not, and right out into midair, luckily
crashing into and grabbing hold of the other side of the chasm, and
narrowly missed by the boulder.  Alexa and Aspen helped them up
afterward.

The Adventure
-------------

The kids' characters talked with Prince Barinjhar and Morval for a
while, then headed off down the indicated path.

They entered the tunnel, and found the main cave full of Goblins, who
they handily defeated, each killing three.  Alexa managed to pick up
the portcullis blocking the tunnel to the tower all by herself, an
impressive deed.  

Later she broke open both doors to the prisoner cells, freeing Xortan
Throg's experimental subjects, the peasants Rufus (hunchback, one arm
6 inches longer than the other) and Sam (triangular head and deformed
legs).  The characters escorted them back through the portcullis and
provided them with torches and directions out of the tunnel, then
returned to the stairs leading upwards beyond the cells.


Reflections
===========

.. |1st| replace:: 1\ `st`:sup:

The kids seemed to enjoy the game: E.A. and M.A. said so explicitly,
and T.A. liked that the characters started out as super competent
Heroes rather than |1st|-level nobodies.  They all liked how they
mowed down the Goblins.  T.A. liked the fact that it added detail to
`FF:TIRpG`, since he likes game systems with more detail.

I think next time I'll add some examples of improvised tactical SKILL
use, to show how combat can be something besides just opposed SKILL
rolls.
