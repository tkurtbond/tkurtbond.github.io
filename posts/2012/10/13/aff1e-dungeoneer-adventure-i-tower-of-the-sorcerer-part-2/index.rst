Scheduling didn't work out again, so L.B. couldn't join us via Google
Hangouts, alas.

Attending
=========

Clockwise, starting with the Director:

+ T.K.B. — Director

+ T.A. — Grimbold Tornhelm

+ M.A. — Gordo Brondwyn

+ E.A. — Aspen Darkfire; she also played Alexa Wolfrica, L.B.'s
  character, since L.B. couldn't attend

Actual Play
===========

At the Griffin's door, they unlocked the door, they unbarred the door,
and then Aspen (at Alexa's suggestion) listens at the door and hears
very interesting things.  They decided to rebar the door and go on.

They opened the Giant Lizard's door, saw the saddle, saw the lizard,
and pulled the door shut and barred it.   

In the Guardroom, there was a lot of throwing chairs, by both sides.
Alexa was reduced to –1 STAMINA by an opponent's :mech:`Mighty Blow`.
Aspen cast :spell:`Stamina`, bringing Alexa back to 5 STAMINA, and
then Gordo was taken to –1 STAMINA by another opponent's :mech:`Mighty
Blow`, and was brought back to 5 STAMINA by another :spell:`Stamina`
from Aspen.  All through the fight the Ogre had been laughing at the
Heroes and throwing stuff at them that knocked them down, but Aspen
had been steadily sniping at them, and despite one impressive
:ss:`Dodge`, where the Ogre interposed a Goblin haunch from his supper
and blocked an arrow she had steadily brought his STAMINA down.  When
the Orcs were finally disposed of and he threw the table on the Heros,
Aspen was far enough back to escape the spill, and switched from
arrows to :spell:`Fire Bolt`, rolled a 6 for damage, and the Ogre fell
down dead!

After the battle Alexa cast :spell:`Stamina` (which for her is
just a natural ability, a “second wind”, not a spell), and got an
:mech:`Oops!`, and E.A. rolled a 13 on the “Oops! Table”, and Alexa
ended up with a pair of small goat horns!  Eventually everybody was
back up to full STAMINA.

In the sorcerer's chambers they killed Xortan Throg and tried **not**
to kill evil Prince Barinjhar by pulling their blows, hoping to return
him to his father for rehabilitation.  However, he died while they
were searching Xortan Throg's study and freeing Princess Sarissa.
They found him dead when the returned to the main chamber.  The real
Xortan Throg clued them in, via a vision in the fire in the fireplace,
that they had killed a fake, and that he was still alive and looking
forward to destroying them and Salamonis.  Since they'd killed the
Prince, they decided traveling to Salamonis with Princess Sarissa was
a good idea, and headed back out through the Goblin cave to avoid
Prince Barinjhar's soldiers, outside, and set off in direction of the
fabled city.

Aftermath
=========

All characters got **+3 XP**.


Reflections
===========

The kids picked up on throwing things pretty quickly; I'll have to see
what other sorts of tactical twists we use.

I enjoyed running this, and the kids had fun.
