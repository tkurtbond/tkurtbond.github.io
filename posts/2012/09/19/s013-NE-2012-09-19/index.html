<p>We block off unused tunnels in our headquarters.</p>
<p>Raum hears voices from far away down unexplored tunnels — a commander
giving instructions to troops — it sounds like <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Need to get <span class="group">V'Sori</span> separatist at lab in docks area, he'll lie on the
floor as soon as trouble starts, he's expecting you.  Here's a
map.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> makes a <span class="skill">Knowledge (Engineering)</span> roll and knows that <em>we</em>
can't be heard by <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>We search for info about Dr. <span class="npc">Aiden</span> online.  He is a member of the
Association of <span class="group">V'Sori</span> Scientists.  They have a lab near the docks, but
the location is classified.</p>
<p>We try to follow voices down the tunnels, but can't find them.</p>
<p>Chow's restaurant is closed down — the whole city is a war zone.</p>
<p>Docks had Farmers' Market, a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> naval outpost, and is area run by
the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> (a band of criminals).</p>
<p>We call Mr. Fixit, who gives us the address of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> weapons
facility that includes <span class="npc">Aiden</span>'s lab; it's well protected and very
secure.</p>
<p>We take one of our panel vans (from our time near the University motor
pool).  Our Fin is riding in the passenger seat and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> is driving.</p>
<p>We are stopped by a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> patrol and <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> tries <span class="power">Mind Control</span>,
but fails.  Raum tries <span class="skill">Persuasion</span> (thank goodness for
<span class="power">Gifted</span>) and gets two raises: “we've got a vital shipment of
lab equipment”, and gets the ok to continue.</p>
<p>We come to a bombed out road, and are forced to take an alternate
route.  Bunches of <span class="group">V'Sori</span> and <span class="org">Neptune Guard</span>'s jump out from opposite sides of
the road to attack each other as we drive by, and we are caught in the
crossfire. (Most of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> are drones.)  We are interrogated by some
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> and then attacked, they blow holes in the sides of our van.  Our
Fin jumps out of the van to protect us, attacking the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  We
retaliate, and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> takes us through an intersection, leaving dead
bodies in our wake.  When we stop we are interrogated by some of the
<span class="org">Neptune Guard</span>, who recognize us and start to attack, but we kill them, and the
last of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> flee.  Our Fin catches up and gets back in the van.</p>
<p>We are finally outside the <span class="place">Center for |VS| Weapons Research</span> —
it is an unmarked building surrounded by a security fence with guard
towers, a couple of blocks from the actual docks.</p>
<p>We got miniaturized and into vials that <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> carried, then <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> threw
fusion grenades at the guards on the towers, and teleported into the
building.  The first room was a loading area, and probably had a few
war spheres.  There is a second room, with more war spheres.  The
third room is absolutely <em>filled</em> with war spheres; <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> dropped
fusion grenades and teleported to the next room, where we finally
found four <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists and one human (apparently a janitor).  All
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists were lying on the floor.  We ask who “<span class="npc">Aiden</span>” is,
the other scientists point him out, and <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> tries to <span class="power">Mind
Control</span> him <strong>[???]</strong> and fails. <span class="npc">Aiden</span> <span class="power">Mind Control</span>'s <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span>; we
eventually figure out that something is definitely wrong because <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span>
talking and acting odd, but we're still in vials and can't do
anything.  Eventually <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> overcomes the <span class="power">Mind Control</span>
(because <span class="npc">Aiden</span> keeps asking for the location of our base), hits him
with the shrink ray, captures him in a vial, and shakes him
unconscious.</p>
<p>Somebody (<strong>[Who???]</strong>) killed the janitor during this.  I presume we
killed the other <span class="group">V'Sori</span> scientists once we knew who was who.</p>
<p>As all this was going on we heard a heavy weight bash into the roof of
the building, and the ceilings of some of the other rooms collapse.
When we get to a position to see, it turns out that an <span class="group">Atlantean</span> sub had
been lifted into the air with <span class="power">Telekinesis</span> and was hovering
over the building.  Heroes were leaving the sub, climbing down into
the weapons facility on ropes.  We must have dropped some fusion
grenades near some of the heroes. We saw <span class="npc">Mechnoman</span> climb up on the roof to
see who was dropping the fusion grenades.  At the same time <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> was
struggling with <span class="npc">Aiden</span> so that we could destroy the <span class="group">Atlantean</span> sub with more
fusion grenades.  Eventually we do, and leave the area in our van.</p>
<p>We headed back across the war-torn city.  After about 2 miles, we run
into what appears to be a <span class="org">Longshoremen</span>-manned check point where they are
stopping every vehicle, inspecting the occupiers and vehicle, and then
waving them on into a warehouse.  There must be some other exit,
because we've seen too many vehicles go into the building.  On
approaching our vehicle the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> take our picture to “check against
their database”, then tells us to exit the vehicle.  <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> teleports
out, drop the Fin and <span class="pc">Raum</span>, and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> jumps out.  <span class="pc">Raum</span> jumps into the
middle of a group of <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> and attacks.  Eventually we kill all but two
of the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> and then the leader — Willy the Fin <strong>[???]</strong> puts up his hands
and says that they can help us.</p>
<p>It turns out that <span class="npc">Ricky Six-Fingers</span> and his gang moved out of Southpoint after
<span class="npc">Dr. D</span>'s revelation into a headquarters in Tempest, and the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> know
where it is and are planning to hit it in a couple of days.  The <span class="org">Longshoremen</span>
tell us that they've heard that <span class="npc">Vince</span> volunteered to do the hit on us
and has disappeared <strong>[???]</strong> while he's working on it.  The <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> offer us a
police car to replace our transportation, but <span class="pc">Raum</span> has noticed
police cars getting attacked and asks for other transportation
options.  They have a couple of motorcycles, and we take them.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Willy the Fin</span> gives us a communicator and tells us we can contact them on
channel 6.  He tells us not to use the regular comm system because
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have gotten real sophisticated in exploiting the regular
system.</p>
<p>We head out and get back to our area without any further mishaps.</p>
<p><span class="pc">Raum</span> asks our minion, Frank, to work on the comms issue, starting by
checking the <span class="org">Longshoremen</span> comm for surprises.  He finds out that it has an
inactive tracking device which can be turned on remotely, but he is
able to remove it, and we can keep it in a Faraday cage. He also says
he can work out a secure method of communication for us.</p>
<p>We work to figure out how to interrogate <span class="npc">Aiden</span> without letting him
keep attempting to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> us.  Our Fin says that the
<span class="npc">Vince</span> don't like cold: 30℉ makes them very uncomfortable, and we
determine that will be enough to keep him from concentrating hard
enough to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> us.  <span class="place">Joe's Pizza</span> is nearby
and closed for the war, so we go there and interrogate <span class="npc">Aiden</span>.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Aiden</span> wants to defect to those who oppose the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  It turns out that
the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> are split — some want to leave earth, thinking that they are
doing more harm than good.  He designed the satellite system to
control the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> drones.  He could stand down all the drones
worldwide.  It can't be done remotely, it has to be done on the space
station.  <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> keeps a space vessel in a warehouse in the Tempest
district.   <span class="npc">Aiden</span> contacted <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> by telepathically broadcasting message
to him — they have met before, so distance is no object.  Each drone
has an auto-destruct function that can be triggered from the
satellite.  Updated battle plans can also be downloaded into the
drones.  The satellite is very heavily defended.  It is manned by
technicians responsible for software maintenance and by Fins, ware
drones, and Super Fins.  The <span class="group">V'Sori</span> <span class="npc">Overmind</span> commanded the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> to attack
Earth at this time.  Several think it was unwise, but when the <span class="npc">Overmind</span>
says something it must be done.  <span class="npc">Aiden</span> opposes because <span class="npc">Overmind</span> has gone mad
and resents the <span class="group">Atlantean</span> overthrow of the <span class="npc">Vince</span> here on Earth.  The <span class="npc">Overmind</span> has
an unreasonable fear of Earth, and has put off the attack several
times, has spent centuries scouting and manipulating behind the scenes
— the <span class="npc">Overmind</span> assisted the Nazis, for instance.   <span class="npc">Aiden</span> hopes that if the
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> fail this time the <span class="npc">Overmind</span> will give up.</p>
<p>The <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have new technology, advanced bio-mechanical manipulation
that allows them to (non-reversibly) change a earthling's biology to
<span class="group">V'Sori</span> biology without affecting any super powers.  (Much improved from
the things along this line that we've seen before.)  Many of the <span class="group">V'Sori</span>
we've seen were former prisoners, mind-wiped.  They mind-wipe the
prisoners, load up a standard <span class="group">V'Sori</span> mind profile, perform the
conversion process, and the former prisoner wakes up a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> in mind
and body!</p>
<p>They make drones from former prisoners who are too badly damaged to
make into <span class="group">V'Sori</span> — war spheres are made from those who are the most
badly damaged. Hyper drones are cybernetic — they look more like the
dead.  Hyper drones are also controlled by programs from the
satellites.  <span class="npc">Anvil</span> tells us issuing the “shutdown” or “auto-destruct”
command to all drones is a simple process.</p>
<p><strong>[¿¿¿I have something here about “protect Tempest district”???]</strong></p>
<p>Those who change to <span class="group">V'Sori</span> gain the <span class="racial">Aquatic</span> and
<span class="racial">Telepathy</span> racial abilities, same as <span class="group">Atlantean</span> as far as stats go,
but look like <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  One ingests the agent and the transformation
takes place over a week.  Don't know if it works on <span class="group">Atlantean</span>.  Some <span class="group">Atlantean</span>
have passed for <span class="group">V'Sori</span> (at least to look at).</p>
<p>The team that was to get <span class="npc">Aiden</span> was planning to get the stuff to make
the change so they could sneak in.  His team was <span class="npc">Lucky</span> and
<span class="npc">4-Star</span> and <span class="npc">Mechnoman</span>.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Ricky Six-Fingers</span> is thought to be a legend, one of those criminal bosses that most
people don't think really exist.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Aiden</span> has sophisticated neural package they us on new <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  (<span class="pc">Force Caster</span> says
that's why they invaded: that and revenge on the <span class="group">Atlantean</span>.) <span class="group">V'Sori</span> have
native psionic abilities that make it difficult to mind-wipe one once
it has been transformed.</p>
<p><span class="group">Atlantean</span> <em>do</em> reproduce biologically.</p>
<p>The drone control satellite <em>is</em> armored heavily — nothing but it own
core exploding can damage the satellite.</p>
<p>Five software technicians to correct faulty programs.  Fins can get
things through DNA scanner (We could go in under skin — scanner only
checks the very outside of the  epidermis).  Drones have a safety
feature — they can't attack <span class="group">V'Sori</span>, alas.</p>
