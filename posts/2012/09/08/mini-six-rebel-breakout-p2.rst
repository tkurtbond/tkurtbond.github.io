Actual Play
===========

Deo in a cargo net was dropped twice down to just above the flames due
to problems with the winch. Finally they got him back to the level
they wanted. Haven Zul pulled the little droid into the tunnel.
Unfortunately, he only figured out he needed some way to keep Deo from
swinging back into the shaft like a pendulum once he'd already pulled
him in.  Luckily, he was able to find a nearby cable he could use to
tie him off.  J'Lee tried to lower the cargo net, but failed horribly,
so the brake on the cable broke and the kilometers long cable started
to unwind.  It turns out the cable wasn't properly fastened to the
drum of the winch, so it was going to come loose and drag Deo into the
depths of the flaming, exploding mine shaft.  [No, R2 units don't have
repulsar lift units!]  Haven, acting quickly, got the cable cut off
the cargo net with his fusion cutter from his toolkit.

It was about this time that the Imperials showed up again.  they
engaged in a running firefight as J'Lee and Milagro climbed down to
Deo and Haven.  They fled down the tunnel and the blast door opened
for them, where they found a huge cavern, their unconscious rebel
contact, and non-working blast door controls, so they couldn't close
the blast doors again.

They found the Y-wings, and the Imperials showed up again.  They held
them off with another firefight while Deo programmed the jump
coordinates into one of the Y-wings and then boarded the other, then
they flew out of the cavern, shooting at and being shot at by the
AT-ATs that had chased their contact into the cavern.
