I got the original |AFF| (`Advanced Fighting Fantasy`) books
(`Dungeoneer`, `Blacksand`, and `Allansia`) after I got |AFF2e| (`Arion
Games`_\'s `Advanced Fighting Fantasy, Second Edition`__), intending
to compare them by reading them and playing them both, along with the
original |FF:TIRpG| (`Fighting Fantasy: The Introductory Role-playing
Game`).  This has gone a lot slower than I intended, but I have played
several sessions of |FF:TIRpG|, and have been rereading and comparing
|AFF| and |AFF2e| recently, in preparation for playing |AFF|.

It looks like |AFF2e| has been adjusted to make play more consistent,
balanced, and suitable for long-term play.  Starting attributes are
point-buy instead of random, and the values for SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK have
lower ranges — 4–7, 8–16, and 4–7 vs. the original 7–12, 14–24, and
7–12.  There's been some addition of detail — random Armor rolls — and
some other tweaking — weapon damages are higher.

|AFF2e| gains a lot from being presented in one book, and integrating
the `Sorcery!` magic system, but there are some places where it is not
explained quite as well as it could be, and there are some
typographical oddities, the illustrations (most — perhaps all — from
the original |AFF|?) are somewhat faded grey rather than the original
black, and I'm not keen on the layout or fonts.

|AFF| definitely harkens back to the wilder, early days of RPGs, when
balance was not so important, and the oracular powers of random
dices were used more.

Organizationally |AFF| suffers from being presented in three books as it
makes reference harder, but pedagogically it may gain — there's a
smaller amount to be learned at once, and it's playable with just the
first book.  The books' smaller physical dimensions make them easier
to hold and read, and the layout is simple and suitable for this size
book.  I think the books generally explain things more clearly, and I
like the movie/TV series metaphor it uses, and the tone of the writing
is a bit more engaging.  And it includes two the mass combat systems.


In short, |AFF2e| is probably the smoother system, though it needs a bit
more polish, but |AFF| is more charming.

One thing about the system as a whole will be an advantage to some and
a disadvantage to others is that the system is *very* simple.  |AFF2e|
adds a few simple tactical options, but even so the combat system has
little detail, while in the original |AFF| there's little besides a
normal attack or a dodge.  Those who enjoy system complexity and
system tactical detail in their systems may find |AFF| and |AFF2e|
lacking, but those who prefer simple systems will find the combats
easy and be glad to get back to the role-playing.
