House Rules
===========

A `Critical Hit`:rule: happens on a natural twenty on an attack roll,
and damage is doubled.

There **isn't** a `Critical Misses`:rule: rule, but sometimes on a
natural one on an attack roll something embarrassing and
funny but usually non-damaging happens.


Actual Play
===========

Went back to 3rd level.  K, S, Za, Ro, Av, Ga popped (teleported away
by a trap).  Semi & Av force open door into corridor.  Pop, Pop.  Find
corpse behind: Semiriah and Karl find 270 gp, 2 gems worth 150 gp
each.  Non-poppers encounter a monster — a giant centipede.  Kill it
in one round with 22 points of damage — it had 2 HP.  Lots more
popping.  3 corpses at I: 300 gp, 140 sp, & dagger.  Room with pews
and altar and ash - clerics uneasy — dark powers here.  Altar has:
dagger, potion, ring, scroll, short sword, 25 gems, necklace.  Avery
casts Detect Evil: nothing on the altar glows, pews don't, but altar
and ash glow eveil.  Pick up potion with rope on pole, sweep other
stuff into bag on pole with another pole.  Door slams shut, Avarey and
Skeggi and Karl and Gustavio make saves vs. Spellsl and everybody else
fails.  Those who failed see the entire chamber turn to flames and
takes one point of damage, then a second point of damage.  Four of us
broke down the door and we all fled.  Back to town.

Gustavio uses Detect Magic on the items: dagger from corpse is +1 (to
Gustavio), dagger from alter is +1 (to Semiriah), potion (polymorph),
ring (silver, magic, unknown, to Karl), scroll (unknown), short
sword +1, +2 vs. spell casters (to Maurey).

Gems: 8×100 gp, 2×150 gp, 5×250 gp, 7×300 gp.  Necklace: 800 gp.
