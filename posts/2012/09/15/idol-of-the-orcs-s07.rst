House Rules
===========

A `Critical Hit`:rule: happens on a natural twenty on an attack roll,
and damage is doubled.

There **isn't** a `Critical Misses`:rule: rule, but sometimes on a
natural one on an attack roll something embarrassing and funny but
usually non-damaging happens. 


Actual Play
===========

Put :hire:`Symna` and :hire:`Gloin` in chain from the last episode.
Each hireling has two torches.

Went west down the last unexplored tunnel on :area:`Level 2`, which we
hand overlooked on our map, it being drawn in so lightly, to a room
with a complex, fancy silver lock on the other exit door.  Trying to
bash it off did no good, nor was Maury able to pick the lock.  We
obviously need a key.

    “Oh no, we're stuck in a video game, gathering keys!” [#keys]_

We gather wood and leather waste from :area:`The Lonely Room` (the
room with the “walk through walls” A.K.A. teleport trap), threw it in
:area:`The Bat Room`, lit it on fire, and brought in torches to drive
the bats towards the chimney to the surface.  Semiriah kills one giant
bat with a natural twenty.  Gustavio kills another giant bat.  Orm
kills a giant bat. Avarey kills the last giant bat.  We search the
room, twice, but find nothing.  We travel back to town.

We don't want to tangle with the wight who's room is near the stairs
down, but we have no choice.  What should we do?  Throw money and
blather at it: buy silver weapons and come up with a good tactical
plan to overrun the wight (and the Labyrinth Lord).

We travel to a town where we buy 4 silver tipped spears (30 gp, 8'
long), 1 silver dager (30 gp), 3 silver maces (50 gp).  Unfortunately
for :pc:`Gustavio`\ 's desire to spice up his wardrobe and
:pc:`Karl`\ 's desire to adorn his beard with jewels, the caravan that
was to bring the town its yearly load of fancy cloth and expensive
jewels was attacked, so :pc:`Karl` and :pc:`Gustavio` will have to
return in a year.  (The rest of the party was rather relieved.)

We return to the dungeon and form up before approaching the wight's
room.  We put the silver spears in front: :pc:`Karl` and :pc:`Sallee
Maree` first because they're short, and :pc:`Maury` and :pc:`Semiriah`
behind them, with :pc:`Orm`, :pc:`Skeggi`, and :pc:`Avarey` ready to
move up to support them with silver maces, if they need help, and
:pc:`Gustavio` behind them.  The plan is to hold the wight off with
the some of the 8' long spears, while stabbing him with the others, so
he can't touch anybody and steel their life force.  :ll:`T.T.` comes
up with some rulings on the fly for the situation, and we move
forward.

:pc:`Gustavio` lets off with his :spell`Magic Missile` in the first
round of combat, while one of the characters manages to entice the
wight into impaling himself on his spear.  The rest attack with their
spears, and in the third round :pc:`Maury` kills it after
:pc:`Semiriah` hits it.  The wight disintegrates.  There is nothing
useful or interesting in the room, alas.

On the 3rd level, :pc:`Karl` and :pc:`Semiriah` and :hire:`Zenith` and
:pc:`Sallee Marie` step into a crossroad and vanish after an instant.
They all hear a slight popping sound and the four who vanished find
themselves in a corridor 60' long.  :pc:`Semiriah` yells, despite a
lot of meta-comments that it will bring monsters, to no avail.
:pc:`Maury`, with the other group, also yells, also to no avail.
:hire:`Zenith` starts to panic, but the PCs in the small group manage
to talk him to a state somewhat closer to calm, despite their lack of
empathy and understanding (Charisma is *everybody's* dump stat!) but
the talking has attracted 3 giant rats!  :pc:`Semiriah` kills a
rat. :pc:`Karl` kills a rat. :pc:`Sallee Marie` kills a rat!  Then
they explore until they walk through another crossing that *pops* them
back to within sight of one of the hirelings the party strewed around
the dungeon as they explored.

.. admonition:: Meta!

   Meta knowledge lets us know that :ll:`T.T.` rolled dice to figure
   out where they would end up, and the characters were lucky!  Random
   teleports, the worst kind!

We marked the crossroads where they disappeared and appeared on the
map.

We all go back to town.

Aftermath
=========

The main party had been using a bulls-eye lantern the whole session,
but an uncertainty about the length of the beam prompts us to look it
up, and of course it is not in `LL` or `AEC`, so I download `OSRIC`
for :ll:`T.T.`



.. [#keys] Actually, `Fabled Curse of the Brigand Crypt`__ is a very
   good `Labyrinth Lord` adventure that has a significant search for
   keys.
