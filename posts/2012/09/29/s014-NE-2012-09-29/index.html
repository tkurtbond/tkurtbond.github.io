<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This week we were joined by I.MC. in his first ever roleplaying game
session!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actual-play">
<h3>Actual Play</h3>
<p>We got a call on the communicator — <span class="pc">Mauler</span>, a friend of <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> from the old
days, has been an undercover spy, and has heard they took the
superhero <span class="npc">Champion</span>. and converted him to <span class="group">V'Sori</span>.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> has been looking for
him, but hasn't found him, but has heard that he might be activated
from the satellite and that his old pals have a mission to the
satellite.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Anvil</span> is <span class="power">Mind Controlled</span>.</p>
<p>It takes four hours to get to the satellite.  We have 6 fusion missiles
and 3 sonic torpedoes for our Manta.  <span class="npc">Anvil</span>'s authority codes are a
couple of weeks old but should still work.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Quillik</span> will pose as <span class="npc">Anvil</span>'s bodyguard and will carry us through the
scanner in one of our traveling vials in his mount.</p>
<p>We head out to sea underwater for five miles, then surface and head
up towards space.  In the atmosphere, a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> man of war questions us.
<span class="npc">Anvil</span> knows that the satellite we're heading towards is Satellite 15 and
bluffs.  They decide they'll escort us through the fighting.  After
two hours we're through most of the fighting and the man of war sends
us the rest of the way with an escort.  In part thanks to the escort's
presence we're cleared to enter the satellite docks despite be
unscheduled.   Once they figure out it is <span class="npc">Anvil</span> on board they're very
respectful.</p>
<p><span class="npc">Quillik</span> sets off a partial alarm when he passes through the regular
scanner.  After a quick explanation from <span class="npc">Anvil</span> that <span class="npc">Quillik</span> had been
injured in a recent fight with Earthlings <strong>[???]</strong> the guards go get a
hand scanner and it goes off around <span class="npc">Quillik</span>'s mouth.  The guards ask
him to open his mouth, which he does, but the vial carrying us pops
out and falls to the floor in front of the guards.</p>
<p>We get out and one Super Fin uses <span class="power">Force Control
(Maneuverable)</span> on us.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> wounds him. <span class="npc">Anvil</span> flees to a corner and
waves his arms about futilely and wibbles, as commanded by <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> using
<span class="power">Mind Control</span>.  <span class="npc">Quillik</span> and <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> attack back, but do not succeed.
Some of us recognize the Super Fin as DeNeg, <strong>[¿¿¿Spelling???]</strong> once
a superhero in the old days.  DeNeg uses <span class="power">Force Control (Bind)</span>
on <span class="pc">Raum</span>, who breaks it by becoming intangible.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> attacks DeNeg,
hitting for 22 damage.  War Spheres are heard approaching and <span class="pc">Mauler</span>
throws DeNeg into War Spheres, destroying one.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> does suppressive
fire against the War Spheres, shaking several.</p>
<p><strong>[¿¿¿Who was the other Super Fin??? I remember it was a villain. How
did we kill him???]</strong></p>
<p><span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> hears noises from the control center.  <span class="pc">Mauler</span> rushes in and smashes a War
Sphere so hard he spins and falls down afterward.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> moves in and
sees <span class="npc">Pyros</span>, who looks half-<span class="group">V'Sori</span> and part zombie.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> kills
<span class="npc">Pyros</span>. <span class="pc">Stygian Veil</span> sends the “broadcast drone self destruct” command from
a terminal in the control center.  A warning message is issued:
“broadcast drone self destruct — Champion ultimatum enabled.”</p>
<p>We find 4 technicians, and escape pod blasts off; it has life signs.
We convince the remaining 4 technicians to enter another escape pod
and we sabotage the reactor core then leave in our Manta.</p>
<p>In the last ½ hour of our journey back to Earth we see Champion — the
strongest super hero of the leading super team before the invasion —
chasing our Manta.  He had been blasted by the <span class="group">V'Sori</span> during the
invasion and thought dead by most, but it turns out he had been
converted to a <span class="group">V'Sori</span> and set up as a deadman trap.  He hits our ship,
wrecking it, and then comes back to peel it open to attack us.  <span class="pc">Raum</span>
hits him.  <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> hits him with a gun and then his power, and kills him!
We get shrunk and let <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> fly us down to Earth.  The battle left us
right over Star City.  Our ship lands in Northpoint, on <span class="org">SoCorp</span>
(the elite <span class="group">V'Sori</span> police and <span class="power">Mind Control</span> force) headquarters
and destroys it.</p>
<p><span class="group">V'Sori</span> ships are retreating as <span class="pc">Force Caster</span> flies us down to near our old
hideout, since we don't want to attract attention to the new hideout.
Someone tries to <span class="power">Mind Control</span> <span class="pc">Force Caster</span>, and when we land <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>
appears with <span class="org">Neptune Guard</span> and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Repent!  Come over to me, or die!”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aftermath">
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>Each PC each got <strong>+5 XP</strong>.</p>
<p>M.A.H. was planning that we'd have the big battle with <span class="npc">Dr. D</span> next time
(which should finish the campaign) and then we'd have one-shots until
January, when M.A.H. will run a <cite>D&amp;D 4e</cite> campaign.</p>
<p>However, the players were talking and decided they wanted at least one
more episode so everybody could level before the big fight with <span class="npc">Dr. D</span>,
perhaps as a flashback, and M.A.H. said she'd see what she could do.</p>
