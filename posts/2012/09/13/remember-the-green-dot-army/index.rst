I've got to remember to enter the rest of our `Keep on the
Borderlands` sessions sometime, if I can find my notes.

This entry is to remind me to explain the heroic fight of the doomed
Green Dot Army, who helped make the world safe from Chaos!

I used green glass tokens to represent the party's hirelings, and the
final climactic battle in the Caves of Chaos included a private army
of hirelings, 50 or so strong.  They were a heroic sight setting out
from the Keep for the Caves.

All but four of them died in the battle, and only two of those four
made it back to the Keep.  The party paid for nice funerals, so people
(probably) don't spit at them as they walk through the Keep.
