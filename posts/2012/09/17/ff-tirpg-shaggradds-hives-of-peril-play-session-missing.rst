   We're playing the adventure `Shaggradd's Hives of Peril` from
   `Fighting Fantasy — The Introductory Role-playing Game`__
   (FF:TIRpG), so if you haven't played that you might want to skip
   this entry.

As I've mentioned before_, I've been trying to use the RPGs derived
from the `Fighting Fantasy` gamebooks for pickup games with the kids_,
starting with the second adventure from `Fighting Fantasy —
The Introductory Role-playing Game` (FF:TIRpG), `Shaggradd's Hives of
Peril`.

I'm Confused
============

For some reason, I think we played another short session of
`FF:TIRpG`, but if so I've lost my notes.  Did :player:`D.B.` play?
Did he play :pc:`Oswald`?
