    We're playing `Idol of the Orcs`, so if you haven't played that you
    might want to skip this entry.

I can't remember if M.A. changed Gustavio to a AEC gnome magic user
this session or last.

Actual Play
===========

Skeggi the Silent says “We must be doing good work here — the gods
have blessed us with healing!” (The kind LL restored all our HP!) “And
gave us back our spells!”

We started in room :area:`12`. We freed a human, Drader, a half-elf,
and a halfing. (The later two were L.B.'s characters, recently seized;
their stuff was still piled in the corner.)

Hirelings: Dwalin (3 HP), Zenith (6 HP, chain), Symna (6 HP), Roger (6
HP), Gloin (6 HP), Ragnar (5 HP).

Rushed into room :area:`13`, Ngarsh's Chamber, which contained Ngarsh
and two subleaders. Ngarsh, the Orc Warlord, is the only survivor of
after one round of combat, and he surrenders.

Ngarsh the Warlord had keys, 30 gp, 21 sp, chain armor, shield,
:loot:`+1 longsword` (which went to Salle Marie), and spear. The 2
subleaders had scale armor, shield, longsword, and spear, as well as
10 gp 20 sp each.

The warlord says he'll lead us to the treasure if we let him live. He
leads us to a room with huge statue, and an ogre!

In the first round, the ogre hits Semiriah for 12 points of damage,
putting here into the negative, but on the second round Skeggi heals
her back to the positive. On the fourth round Sallee Marie makes the
killing blow on the ogre.

Loot: small chest with 488 gp, 20 sp, a :item:`+1 shield` (which the
ogre had been using as a plate), and an elven skill missing its
jawbone, but containing a filthy gold earring, worth 25 GP.

We try to pull over the idol, but it won't budge. Maury climbs it, and
finds that there is a ladder leading down through the idol, and a
siting room in the chest where someone can speak so it sounds like the
idol is speaking.

We go back to town and heal and sell the loot.
