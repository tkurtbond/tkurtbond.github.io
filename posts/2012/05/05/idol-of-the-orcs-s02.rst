Actual Play

Orm and Skeggi switched places in the marching order.

Tristan agreed that “Shields will be splintered!” and magic and
falling.

:dead:`Balin`, who died last session, had chain armor, 2 darts, and a
longsword.  :dead:`Oin`, who died last session, had leather armor,
spear, and 2 darts.

We gave Balin's chain to Zenith.

:area:`6`.  Orc command post, leader with 12 warriors.  Gustavio
and Maury went down (to negative hit points) but were healed to
positive hit points by Skeggi and Orm respectively.

Killed leader and 6 warriors.  There was a crude map with X marks
showing the location of recent raids.  Loot bodies: leader had scale
armor, shield, and longsword. Others had leather armor, short swords,
hand axes.

Loot others as we retreat.  16 other orcs: leather armor, 2 spears, 6
hand axes, 6 slings, 8 spears, 8 short bows.

220 XP for 22 orcs, 140 XP for 4 wolves, 10 XP for leader. 360 XP
total = 60 XP each.  
XP each.

50 gp plus 24 sp plus 7 sp plus gold from equipment = 96 gp 8 sp 3 cp each.

Total including gold from selling treasure is 159 XP.

Back to village, sell all stuff.

Pay all hirelings 1 gp, and 1 gp to families of 2 dead hirelings.
(The funerals were last session.)

Alana — healer from nearby town — discovered parchment wandering in
the hills as a child with friends.  It reads:

| Right then left and left again
| Avoid the wood and right again
| Right once more and right once more
| Knock upon the wooden door
| Right now twice and left is nice
| And takes you to the water
| Back up son and left is one
| To take you to the hotter

Caysec is the girl who takes care of a PC's dog while we are in the
caves.

We go on a trip with Gustaff, looking for alternate entrances, traps,
etc.  We spend 3 days searching, and on the third day at midmorning we
surprised 7 orcs.  We killed 6 and captured 1.

7 leather armor, 7 hand axes, 7 slings.  46 sp 32 cp, and 70 XP.

They were going to swear loyalty to warlord Ngarsh in Sacern Hills
where the Hidden Dagger trip have taken refuge.  Warlord Ngarsh acts
on orders from a powerful demon that resides in the idol.  The orcs
are gaining stength due to the demon.

The only entrance that this band of orcs knew was the entrance that we
used before.

Gezn worshiped demons below the Sacrern Hills.

There is an ogre!  Walk through walls?  No!  Not that he knows.

Agashhak is the captured orcs name.  He submits, and becomes our
follower.
