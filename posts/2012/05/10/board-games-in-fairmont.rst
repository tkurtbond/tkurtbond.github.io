Played board games in Fairmont this evening, 1 game of `Vegas Showdown`
[1_, 2_, 3_] and 1 game of `Cosmic Encounter` (the Avalon Hill version)
[4_, 5_, 6_].  

This was the 1\ :sup:`st` time I've played `Vegas Showdown` and the
2\ :sup:`nd` time I've played `Cosmic Encounter`.  I'll need to play a
lot more before I figure out good strategies.
