   We're playing `Idol of the Orcs`, so if you haven't played that you
   might want to skip this entry.

This session lasted from 1:30 pm to 4:11 pm.

I think this is session where the class options from the `Advanced
Edition Companion` (See (free no art version) 1_, (priced version) 2_)
became available and some of the characters switched to new classes.
(For `Labyrinth Lord`, see (free no art version) 3_, (priced version) 4_.)

Actual Play
===========

We arm the orc Agashhak with a hand ax.  He has 5 HP.  (Not a popular
move with the villagers.)

We've got 219 XP (plus our individual XP bonuses, if any) total so far
for the campaign.

6 hirelings: Dwalin (3 HP), Zenith (6 HP; chain), Symna (6 HP), Roger
(6 HP), Gloin (6 HP), Ragnar (5 HP).

At cross road past command center explored all ways: tunnel ends, orc
guard, double door.  Found room with pool with mineral encrusted
object — a water tight :loot:`scroll`.

Went down to where orc vanished after seeing us.  (Semiriah and who?)
The orcs had barricaded the door.  We killed 7 orcs and our orc
follower died. Knocked out one orc.  8 hand axes, 8 spears, 8 leather
armor. 

We found a torture chamber with a human corpse.

Left Gustavio and Ragnar at the double doors and Roger at the 3-way
intersection.  Rescued human male from the torture chamber.

Karl had gotten to –2 HP, but Skeggi healed him.  Orm was at –1 HP.

We were still in the chamber when the game session ended.
