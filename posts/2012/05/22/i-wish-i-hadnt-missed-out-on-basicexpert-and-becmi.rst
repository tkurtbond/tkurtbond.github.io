I wish I hadn't missed out on Basic/Expert and BECMI D&D, back when I
first started playing AD&D.  I think they provided a simpler, more
coherent version of D&D.  I wouldn't have wanted to give up Gygax's
entertaining prose style, though, so I wish I'd not rejected B/X
and BECMI, not replaced AD&D.
