Introduction
============


Actual Play
===========

Our villains pass a couple of uneventful weeks.  

We are watching TV in our Secret Lair when a VON (Visori Official
News) bulletin erupts onto the screen.  “Large Resistance Cell”
destroyed in Visori golf club.  Digging up golf course to see what
else the resistance has been up to.

Also, a new and persistent commercial — Anvil endorsing a superpower
enhancing drug (which the players decided was in the style of those
late night “male enhancement” drug advertisements) “Super Oh Yes”
(SOY) for 3 easy payments of 50K$!  Allows you to create new,
customized power profile by switching old powers out.  Anvil's new
name: **Mechno-Man!**

Drug we found was red, these are green, but same form factor/design.
And isn't being super-powered illegal under Vsori rule anyway?  We
think it is a trap!

We have a remote control for Anvil's lair, but no surveillance
cameras.

We go to Anvil's HQ — mud and tracks in office above, otherwise the
same.  Lots of obvious surveillance cameras.  SV goes down invisible
and finds a `RoboRally-like trap room!`_.

   RoboRally-like trap room!
   

We find 8 2’ tall robots with blasters running in place.  Ceilings are
only 7 feet up.  (Blue lines outline conveyor belts, blue triangles
show direction of travel, purple lines are lasers, red are flames,
green circles are crushers on the ceilings, green rectangles are
pushers, purple dot is a button on the floor, green dot is a button on
the ceiling.)

Raum wounded for 2 wounds on 1st round, but Regenerates 1 wound.
Distance attacks from others take out several robots.

When Raum stands on ceiling on 2nd (green) button all the mechanisms
stop and the fires die down.  When a deactivated robot is placed on
the 1st (purple) button a trap door opens that leads to a corridor
with a glowing square.  The Stygian Veil stands on the glow and
teleports.  Force Caster follows.  Raum turns incorporeal (trapdoor
closes and mechanisms and fires start again) and joins the others.

Corridor leads to a 4” cube robot.  

(We forgot our shrink ray.)

SV tries new glowing square.  Raum sneaks by the doom bot with 4 aces
on his roll and gets benny.  Teleports to next corridor.  SV kills
bot.  FC kills bot.  Raum melee kills bot.  2 new glowing squares.

Scavenged big blasters from bots.  Not human operable, but could
probably be modified.  2× as good as electro lance, but Range 1.
Cosmic Ray Guns.  Size medium.  Next tunnel 2 bots with Range 2+ CRGs,
medium.  Raum teleports to SV & melee kills bot.  FC telejoins us,
wanders around & finds a bot & attacks and kills.

Raum hit for 6 wounds, soaked 1, succeeded at Vigor roll, unconcious,
temporarily useless right arm.  SV kills bot.  SV med stims Raum,
restoring 2 wounds.  Raum conscious again.  Raum and SV and FC
scrounge 2 blasters each with Range 2+.

**TODO:** We need to work out a silent com link signal system for SV when
wandering in front, something faster than texting on our com
links. 

SV teleports, 2 bots.

FC teleports, ends same place as SV. 2 more dead bots.

Everybody has 3 medium 2+ Range CRGs, medium.

We killed 8 little bots in first room, 9 medium bots in the
teleporting maze.

Final glowing square takes us to exit, SV opens door, big bot.
(4 squares by 4 squares.)  It has 4 weapons, and the big room is 24’
tall.

Raum crosses room incorporeally and tries to pass through the door on
the other side, but is stopped by a nullifier field just inside the
door.  Can't see past.

FC knocked out, permanent injury (Strength is down 1 die to d4.)

Take out cameras on big bot-o'-doom and it powers down.  We open the
door and enter the room and the superhero formerly known as Anvil (now
Mecho-Man) is there, spouts some insults, and attacks.  We retreat and
use ranged attacks.

Raum inflicts the wound that takes Anvil out of the fight (a permanent
injury to Anvil results, his agility goes down 1 die), then cuts off
Anvil's hands and feet.  Anvil's blood is green, he is part man and
part machine.  He has an antenna fixed to his skull and communications
gear attached to it.  Raum digs them out and we examine them.
Somebody (Raum?) gets a raise on their roll: it's Vsori tech with bio
engineering: DNA mods and cyborg mods.  Robot weapons are keyed to the
same electrical signal — they are Vsori, too!

We leave the headquarters, after cauterizing Anvil's wounds, taking
him with us.

**TODO:** We need to include a medical bay in our Secret Lair!

**TODO:** Force Caster needs to buy a gun, for times when our super
powers don't work!

Aftermath
=========

We'll save Anvil's interrogation for next week.

Each PC each got **+3 XP**.

C.A.H took the Headquarters Edge from the `Super Powers Companion` last time. 
B.MC. might take it this time.

Each time a group member takes the edge we get 5 points to spend on
our headquarters.

The combat took longer than expected.
