This session lasted from 1 pm to 2:30 pm.

Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:

+ T.A. — Labyrinth Lord

House Rules
===========

A `Critical Hit`:house: happens on a natural twenty on an attack roll,
and damage is doubled.

There **isn't** a `Critical Misses`:house: rule, but sometimes on a
natural one on an attack roll something embarrassing and
funny but usually non-damaging happens.


Actual Play
===========

:pc:`Karl` puts on Ring.  :pc:`Karl` takes it off.  :pc:`Karl` puts it
back on.  :pc:`Orm` scratches him, but the scratch doesn't heal instantly.

Went back to 3rd level of the dungeon.

:pc:`Maury` successfully opens a lock!  (For the 2\ :sup:`nd` time in
this dungeon, we think.)

5 Adventurer corpses, one dressed as a magic user: 120 gp, 400 ep,
scroll.  Nothing else worth taking.

Found room with pool of clear water, with a figure chained at the
bottom, struggling.  Can't reach it with a 10 foot pole.  Can't pull
it up with rope and grappling hook.  Men see it as a beautiful woman
and the women see it as a handsome man, while :pc:`Avarey` sees it as
a beautiful elven princess.  Tied a rope to :pc:`Maury` and sent her
down to pick lock.  Takes a couple of tries.  :pc:`Maury` puts other
rope noose around the figure.  She sees the figure wither into a
skeleton.  We pull them both up.  :pc:`Maury` gets the boots and pouch
off the skeleton, which convinces :pc:`Orm` that it's not as it seems.

The pouch contains thieves tools, 157 gp, 45 sp, and 2 gems, worth
150 sp each. There is a rusty longsword.  :pc:`Orm` smashes the sword
against the wall.  It breaks.

:pc:`Orm` touches the figure, and sees it wither into a skeleton.  He
bashes the bones into pieces, then wipes the bone dust from his mace.
The others see :pc:`Orm` bash the beautiful man/woman into pieces,
then wipe the blood from his mace.

Back to the village.

Aftermath
=========

Pay 3 gp each to the hirelings, 18 gp total.

Total gold from last time and this: 6031.5 gp, so 753.93 gp each.
Total XP from last time and this: **+816 XP** each!  With a 5% XP
bonus that is **+856 XP**!

So ends `The Idol of the Orcs`!

Messenger arrives with letter for us.  From Mortimer Bean, scribe of
the Library of Tobin.  Commends us for driving out orcs.  Offers us a
job retrieving the `Hyperion Cantos` from the estate of :npc:`Tazimack
the Red`, which had been checked out from the Library years before by
:npc:`Tazimack the Red`, who has since died at his estate in in the
village of Tolb.  They'll pay us 1000 gp.
