Actual Play
===========

Started in town: down through idol, through secret door, first door on
west of North end of corridor.  Chalice from pedestal — mysterious
runes, very fancy.  :pc:`Avarey` carries it.  Found Bat room — someone
saw 4 *really large* bats, halfling to dwarf size.  :pc:`Karl` is
afraid of the bats.  We fled.  In another room :pc:`Maury` found the
place where you could walk through walls, and :pc:`Orm` went in after
them when they didn't come back out.  In teleportation trap found 3
corpses: #1, in a tattered robe, had 150 gp and a wand of detect
traps; #2 had chain armor, shield +1, longsword +1, pouch with 150 gp
24 sp; #3 had chain armor, mace, shield, holy symbol, bag of holding
with 160 gp 34 ep.  Took stuff, and then Semiriah pulled us back with
a 10' pole.  Wrote “Trap!” on wall around teleport trap in every
language we knew.  :pc:`Avarey` sick.  :pc:`Skeggi` smashed chalice
with mace, but it didn't hurt the chalice or help :pc:`Avarey`. Tried
to put through wall, but it didn't go.  Tied rope to :pc:`Avarey` and
have him hold on to a 10' pole — :pc:`Avery` steps through, chalice
does not.  :spell:`Cure light wounds` gave Avarey back HP, but by the
time were' back to town Avery didn't have many left.  Rotting because
he took the chalice, we surmised.  Back to dungeon to room with altar.
Put chalice on altar and wrote “Trap!” nearby.

1 gp to each hireling.

:loot:`Wand of detecting traps` went to Gustavio, the :loot:`+1
longsword` to Karl, and the :loot:`bag of holding`.
