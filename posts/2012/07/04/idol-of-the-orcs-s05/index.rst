Actual Play
===========

Hirelings: Ragnar, Symna, Dwalin, Zenith (has chain mail), Roger, Gloin.

Orm & Semiriah break in the last door on the first level, barricade
gives way and 4 orcs are surprised.  Common area.  Stuffed manticore
head (no teeth, must have died of old age).  550 gp worth of
silverware. Tapestries 4×100 gp.  Maury sticks here hand down the
manticore throat.  We found the mom and child orcs in a sleeping
room.  Escorted out, threatened them  with death.  

Tribe of the hidden dagger.

Ngarsh held feast, Idol spoke and demanded something to eat.  Ngarsh
gave Ido sacrifices — left food at feet of Idol.  2 small rooms off
sleeping chamber, one with door and the other without.  2 elves and
halfling.  Boxes of edibles, decomposing.  Keys from Ngarsh check for
traps then use them.  Room with door has three chests!  Treasury!  Too
heavy to move with 10' pole.  Opened middle chest (#2) - 2 spring
loaded daggers were released, but missed since Maury opened the chest
with short sword.  1500 sp and small statue worth 500 gp — the orc god
of fire.  He has three hands, one holding a hammer, one a sword, and
one, in the center of his chest, holds a ball of fire.  Chest #1, on
left, 2300 cp.  Chest #3: Locked.  15 gems: 5×100 gp, 7×150 gp, 3×250
gp, :loot:`two healing potions`, :loot:`three potions of speed`,
:loot:`1 gaseous form potion`.  Went back to town and sold stuff.

The :loot:`+1 longsword` went to Sallee Marie.  The :loot:`+1 shield`
to Semiriah.

We got 638 XP!  We already had 219 XP, so the total for each of us is
857 XP, not counting any personal XP bonus..

2556 ÷ 8 = 319.5 from this adventure.

We pay the six hirelings each 5⅓ gp; that's 4 gp from each PC.

We returned to the room with the hollow idol.  Enter through the Eyes
(it's a squeeze for larger folks), down to the sitting room in the
chest, and then down the ladder, Semiriah and Gustavio first.

We find :npc:`Talen Zyn`, who wears robes without any armor or
weapons.  He's been living here and tricking the orcs into giving him
food.  He heads back to civilization on hearing that we've cleared
the upper caves.  We search and find a secret door.

Trophy room, missing the trophies, but having pale ghostly forms where
they were.  Black Bear materializes when we stayed too long. Avery
took 2 points of damage and we retreated.  Other ghostly trophies were
starting to materialize, too.

Followed other passageway, several rooms, find stairs down, but the
room beyond had a wight.  Skeggi got initiative, recognized it as a
wight, and we all fled!  All the way back to town.
