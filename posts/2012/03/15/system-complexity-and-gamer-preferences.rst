From `Howling Tower: Complexity and Option Fatigue « Kobold
Quarterly`__, by `Steve Winter`_ (ex-TSR, ex-WotC):

   In the late 1980s, TSR studied the sales appeal of AD&D compared to
   “Basic” D&D (Basic/Expert, B/X, or BECMI, as it’s now known). The
   common wisdom was that Basic D&D was the best choice for beginning
   players because it was a simpler game—it had fewer rules. New and
   inexperienced players, however, actually saw that paucity of rules as
   a drawback. To them, Basic D&D was more complex than Advanced D&D, not
   less, because the DM and players were faced with more situations that
   had no clear solution. In contrast, AD&D told you exactly (or
   approximately) what to do in an enormous range of situations. The
   answers might be hard to find, but they were in those books
   somewhere. Extensive rules that covered more situations translated to
   the DM spending more time flipping pages in a search for answers but
   less time sifting through options. The end result was a perception
   that while AD&D had more rules than Basic D&D, all those rules made it
   easier to play. Inexperienced players liked the confidence that came
   from AD&D providing all the answers, so they gravitated toward
   AD&D. Experienced players liked having open-ended options and were the
   main audience for Basic D&D.

   That result surprised a lot of people inside TSR. It was an
   eye-opener, and it affected design and marketing philosophy for years.
