Current Listening
-----------------

* `whites off earth now!!`, `the trinity session`, `the
  caution horses`, `black eyed man` by the `Cowbody Junkies
  <http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/>`__.

Recent Reading
--------------

* `Ada as a Second Language, Second Edition`, by Norman
  Cohen.

  Weighing in at three ounces heavier than `The C++ Programming
  Language` by Bjarne Stroustrup, `Ada as a Second Language` seems to
  be at least as complete for Ada 95 as Stroustrup's book was for
  C++.  It's definitely the book to have for a complete explanation of
  Ada 95, and it's well written and clear.
