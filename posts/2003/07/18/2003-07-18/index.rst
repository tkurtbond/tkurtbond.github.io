Software Engineering is not (yet) Engineering
---------------------------------------------

`SWEBOK <http://www.swebok.org/>`__, the IEEE Computer Society's Guide
to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge, is available as a
public draft for trial.  It is written to be the basis for licensing
software engineering professionals.

I do not think that "Software Engineering" is mature enough that it is
an actual engineering discipline, and I do not think that "Software
Engineers" should be licensed, although I would not be upset if
governments refuse to allow computer programmers to be called
"Software Engineers" because they aren't licensed engineers.

The ACM `does not promote licensing of software engineers.

Cem Kaner's `thoughts

SWEBOK are interesting.
