+ `Blood and Fog`, by Nancy Holder.  This `Buffy the Vampire Slayer
  <http://www.buffyguide.com/>`__ novel was mentioned briefly on a
  newsgroup or mailing list I read (I can't remember which) and sounded
  interesting (a Victorian Slayer and Jack the Ripper), so I when I saw
  it at the library I checked it out.  It was ok, but nothing special.
+ `Poets and Murder`, a `Judge Dee
  <http://www.friesian.com/ross/dee.htm>`__ mystery by Robert van Gulik.
+ `Empire from the Ashes`, by David Weber.  This is an omnibus edition
  of `Mutineers' Moon`, `The Armageddon Inheritance`, and `Heirs of
  Empire`.  Straightforward, well written military science fiction.
