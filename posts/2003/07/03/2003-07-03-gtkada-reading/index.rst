GtkAda
------

The `GtkAda <http://libre.act-europe.fr/GtkAda/>`__ folks have
released a new version of GtkAda for Gtk+-2.2 and it includes an
easily installed binary release.  It looks to me like the easiest way
to get started writing cross-platform Gtk+ programs is to install `GNAT
3.15p <ftp://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/3.15p/winnt/gnat-3.15p-nt.exe>`__
and `GNATWIN
<ftp://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/3.15p/winnt/gnatwin-3.15p.exe>`__ then
install the new `GtkAda <http://libre.act-
europe.fr/GtkAda/gtkada-2.2.0.exe>`__ release.  Reasonably complete
examples are included in the distribution.

Recent Reading
--------------

.. _more-earthsea-tales:

+ `The Other Wind` and `Tales from Earthsea`, by Ursula K. LeGuin.  I
  was very glad to see that there were still :series:`Earthsea` tales that
  LeGuin wanted to tell.  Both of these books are quite good.

.. _college:

+ `A College of Magics`__ by Caroline Stevermer.  This is a very entertaining
  `Ruritanian <http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_country>`__
  fantasy in an alternate world with a touch of magic.  I've enjoyed her
  other works as well: `The Serpent's Egg`, `When the King Comes Home`,
  and `Sorcery and Cecelia` (co-written with Patricia C. Wrede).  I
  haven't read `River Rats` yet, though.

+ `The Haunted Monastery, a Chinese Detective Story`, by Robert van
  Gulik.  An enjoyable `Judge Dee
  <http://www.friesian.com/ross/dee.htm>`__ mystery.
