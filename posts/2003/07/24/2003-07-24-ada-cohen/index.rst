I'm still working my way slowly through Cohen's `Ada as a Second
Language, Second Edition <link://slug/2003-07-09#cohen-ada95>`__.
Ada takes a much more conservative approach to reliability
than any of the BCPL/C languages (including Java), and in some cases
more even than the Pascal/Modula/Oberon languages, so there are more
restrictions on how some things are treated.  Looking carefully at the
language, I can understand the reasons for the restrictions, but
abiding by them takes more up-front planning than is promoted by the
BCPL/C languages.  Is the additional effort worth the extra reliability
for general purpose applications programming? That's what I hope to
find out.  It's easy to see, now that I'm back to using a language that
doesn't include garbage collection as part of the standard, how much
easier garbage collection makes interface design;
`Modula-3 <http://www.m3.org/>`__ or Java have a definite advantage here.
