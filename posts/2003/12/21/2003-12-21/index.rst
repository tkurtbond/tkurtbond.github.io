+ `The Element of Fire`, by Martha Wells, Tor, 1993.  After reading
  `one of Wells' books about Ile-Rein`__ I went search for others.  It
  turns out that Wells has written a number of books about about
  Ile-Rein at various points during its history.  `The Element of
  Fire` is set during Ile-Rein's era of muskets and swords, and is a
  very good mixture of swashbuckling and magic.  I look forward to
  reading more of Wells' works.
