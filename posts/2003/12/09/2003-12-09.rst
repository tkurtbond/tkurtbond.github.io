+ `Ghost of the White Nights`, by L.E. Modesitt, Jr; Tor, 2002.  A
  sequel to `Of Tangible Ghosts` and `The Ghost of the Revelator`,
  this third book in the series of alternate history mysteries about
  Dr.  Johan Eschbach continues the strenghts of the earlier
  books.  Set in an version of Earth where ghosts are real and the
  United States never formed, these books use education, the arts,
  politics, ecology, and intrigue to show their setting and embroil
  the reader in Eschbach's adventures.  The society Modesitt builds is
  interesting, and books are well written.
