I was wandering around `rpg.net <http://www.rpg.net/>`__ and ran
across Sergio Mascarenhas's excellent `review
<http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9189.phtml>`__ of `Chaosium's
<http://www.chaosium.com/>`__ 1989 roleplaying game `PRINCE VALIANT,
THE STORYTELLING GAME`.  I regard this game as one of the very best
examples of how to write a game.  Simple rules that are flexible and
widely applicable, excellent presentation, and outstanding setting
material all combine to make a wonderful game and one that is very
good for introducing roleplaying games to new players.  It's a pity it
was unsuccessful commercially and will never be reprinted, but it's
hard to know what to blame for that failure.  Was it a failure of
marketing? Limited distribution? Limited interest?

[2019-11-10: What do I know?  It turns out a new edition was
kickstarted_ in 2016, though they were still fulfilling things in
2019.]
