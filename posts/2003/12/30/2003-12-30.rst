John Clute said some interesting things about `Hard SF
<http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue289/excess.html>`__ in his November
2003 review of `The Hard SF Renaissance` (edited by David G .Hartwell
and Kathryn Cramer, Tor Books).

He also has some interesting things to say about `the new adventure SF
<http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue93/excess.html>`__ and the `old
adventure SF <http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue85/excess.html>`__.

   Right.  Modern space operas are kind of analogous to … operas.  The
   old joke-formulation is, perhaps, more than just a joke.  Both operas
   and space operas are absurd when described realistically; and both
   make sense only when they lunge and lurch after the sublime.  And
   sometimes reach it.  Operas and space operas are music: they are songs
   about the sublime.  — `John Clute
   <http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue153/excess.html>`__, in his column
   Excessive Candor
