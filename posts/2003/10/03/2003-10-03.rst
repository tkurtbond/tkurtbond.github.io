+ `One Virgin Too Many`, by Lindsey Davis.  Davis's Falco novels are
  about a Roman informer mixing it up with low-lifes and senator's
  daughters, and are a little in the style of the hard-boiled private
  detective novels.  That is slightly disconcerting, but they are very
  enjoyable once you've adjusted your viewpoint a little.

+ `Ambrose Bierce & the One-Eyed Jacks`, by Oakley M. Hall.
