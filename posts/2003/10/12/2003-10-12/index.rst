+ `The Iron Hand of Mars` and `Poseidon's Gold`, by Lindsey Davis.  It's
  interesting to see Falco in Gaul and Germania in the first book, and
  to see how Falco deals with his absentee father in the second.
+ `Orlando: A Biography`, by Virginia Woolf.  (Surprisingly, if I recall
  correctly, the film version is a fairly good adaptation.)
