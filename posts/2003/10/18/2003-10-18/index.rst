+ `Master of Rain`, by Tom Bradby.  This is an interesting murder mystery
  set in the late 1920s in Shanghai.
+ `Sign of the Unicorn`, by Roger Zelazny.  This is the the third novel
  in the first Amber series.  I listened to the unabridged audio version
  from Sunset Productions over the course of a week or so in my car
  going back and forth to work, and enjoyed it immensely.
