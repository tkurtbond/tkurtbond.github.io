+ `Nice Princes in Amber`, by Roger Zelazny.  This is the first book in
  the first Amber series.  I listened to this unabridged audio version
  from Sunset Productions, read by the author, in my car of the course
  of a couple of weeks.  I've always enjoyed the Roger Zelazny's fiction,
  and the Amber books in particular, so it was interesting to see how
  they stood up in their audio versions; overall, quite well.  I `reread
  <../../../notes.html#rereading-books>`__ both Amber series every five
  to ten years or so.
