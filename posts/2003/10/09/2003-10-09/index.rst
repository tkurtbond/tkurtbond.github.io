+ `Silver Pigs`, `Shadows in Bronze`, and `Venus in Copper`, and I'm
  working on `The Iron Hand of Mars`, by Lindsey Davis.  Prompted by
  reading one of the later books in the series `One Virgin Too Many
  <link://slug/2003-10-03#one-virgin-too-many>`__, I've been re-
  reading Lindsey Davis's Marcus Didius Falco books.  So far I've re-read
  the first three, and I'm working on the fourth.  These are all very
  good books.
+ `Shadow Warrior, Book 1: The Wind After Time`, `The Shadow Warrior,
  Book 2: Hunt the Heavens`, and `Shadow Warrior, Book 3: Darkness of
  God`, by Chris Bunch.  Adequate space opera.
+ `Titan`, `Wizard`, and `Demon`, by John Varley.  Fantastically
  inventive, these are wonderful books.
