I finally got my copy of `HeroQuest` today.  While I've not yet had
time to read it through completely it's easy to see that it is an
excellent game.  While it uses the same base mechanics as its
predecessor, `Hero Wars`, it is a new, although compatible, game: it
does not just correct the flaws of, it greatly improves on the
successes of `Hero Wars`.
