+ `H.M.S. Surprise`, `The Mauritius Command`, and `Desolation Island`,
  by Patrick O'Brian.

+ `SPQR V: Saturnalia`, by John Maddox Roberts.  I've always enjoyed
  Roberts's books, including his earlier SF, and was glad when, after a
  hiatus, more of his SPQR novels turned up.  In some ways Decius
  Cecilius Metellus seems more of a typical Roman than the protagonists
  of Saylor or Davis.  I enjoy Saylor's books the most, I think, with
  Davis's books coming after Roberts's.

`Space Opera Redefined <http://www.sfrevu.com/ISSUES/2003/0308/Space%2
0Opera%20Redefined/Review.htm>`__ is an interesting article that that
points out that the term *space opera* has changed in connotation from
“bad science fiction” to “colorful, large scale, science fiction
adventure”.  I was vaguely aware that such a change had happened, but
was uneasy with it, and sometimes described books as “well written
space opera”.
