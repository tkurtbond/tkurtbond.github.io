+ `Ruled Britannia`, by Harry Turtledove.  What if the Spanish Armada
  had succeeded in landing in Britan? Shakespeare and consipracy.
+ `Person or Persons Unknown`, by Bruce Alexander.  The fourth Sir John
  Fielding mystery.
+ `Snow Crash`, by Neal Stephenson.  I've finally got around to reading
  this, and enjoyed it greatly.  Lots of neat ideas.
