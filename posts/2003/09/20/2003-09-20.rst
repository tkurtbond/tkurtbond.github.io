+ `Master and Commander` and `Post Captain`, by Patrick O'Brian.  `Post
  Captain`, the second book in O'Brian's series of Napoleonic era
  British Navy novels featuring Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, is
  considered by many to be the best of the series, and is often
  recommended as the book to read first.  It is easy to see why: many of
  the recurring characters of the series are introduced here for the
  first time, as well as the seeds of many things that are resolved much
  latter.

  I agree that it is one of the best books of the series, perhaps the
  best, but I do not think it ideal as an introduction to the series.
  Without the background given by `Master and Commander` I think that
  `Post Captain` is harder to follow and the relationship between
  Aubrey and Maturin much harder to understand.  I think it is much
  better for the reader new to Aubrey and Maturin to begin with
  `Master and Commander`, a simpler (though not simple) book and to
  get a good feeling for the two and their world before tackling the
  lengthier and more involved `Post Captain`.

  Certainly my own experience agrees with this course: I first read
  `Post Captain` in the early '90s, and found it a real struggle to
  finish.  Perhaps a year later I found a copy of `Master and
  Commander` and was enthralled.  I immediately re-read `Post Captain`
  and was further enthralled: in this re-reading the book pulled me in
  and carried me through the story in a state of eager concentration,
  much better prepared to see what the book had to offer.

+ `Ashes of Victory` and `War of Honor`, by David Weber.  These books,
  the nineth and tenth of Weber's vastly popular science fiction novels
  about Honor Harrington, an officer in the Royal Navy of the Star
  Kingdom of Manticore, chronicle then events taking place after
  Harrington's return from imprisonment and presumed death, the downfall
  of the People's Republic of Haven, the reformation of the Republic of
  Haven, and the continuing tensions between Haven and Manticore.  The
  Honor Harrington series are well written military science fiction,
  probably the best series of any of the current crop of this currently
  quite popular sub-genre.

+ `Illium`, by Dan Simmons.  This novel, the first of two, is an
  interesting blend of mythology and science fiction, mixing a re-
  enactment of the `Iliad` (observed by academics re-embodied and
  recycled at the whim of the gods), the reawakening of a
  post-*PostÂ Human* Earth, and the scrutiny and action of the robotic
  residents of the outer solar system into an interesting and engaging
  story.  I'm looking forward to reading `Olympos`, the concluding
  book of the duology.

+ `Captain Kilburnie`, by William P.  Mack.  Mack is a retired U.S. Navy
  Vice Admiral and this is his first novel about Fergus Kilburnie, a
  young Scottish officer in the Napoleonic era British Navy.  It was
  originally published by the Naval Institute Press.  I enjoyed the book,
  although the last third seemed to lag, and am looking forward to
  reading the sequel.

+ `Unicorn's Blood`, by Patricia Finney.  Intrigue and espionage in the
  London and Court of Queen Elizabeth I, this is excellent historical
  fiction with interesting characters, story, and an excellent
  recreation of Elizabethan England.

+ `Otherness`, by David Brin.  A collection of Brin's short stories.
