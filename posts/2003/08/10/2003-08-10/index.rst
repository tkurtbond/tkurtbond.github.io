+ `The Forge of the Titans`, by Steve White.  Adequate science fiction.

+ `A Scattering of Jades`, by Alexander C. Irvine.  Enjoyable magical
  historical, somewhat in the Tim Powers mode, with an interesting
  Mesoamerican tone and pictures of early and mid 1800s New York and
  Mammoth Cave.  (I actually read this last month, I think.)

+ `A Thousand Words for Stranger`, by Julie E. Czerneda.  Competent
  space opera.

+ `And No Birds Sang`, by Farley Mowat.  The horrors of war; a antidote
  to mindless jingoism.

+ `The Tribune`, by Patrick Larkin.  Competent historical adventure
  during the early Roman Empire, with incidental cameos of a couple of
  famous people.
