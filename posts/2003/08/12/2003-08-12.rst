+ `Never Cry Wolf`, by Farley Mowat.  In this amusing story inspired
  by the time Mowat spent in the Keewatin Barrens in the early middle
  twentieth century Mowat succeeds in arousing our interest in and
  sympathy for wolves in a way both entertaining and serious.

      Whenever and wherever men have engaged in the mindless slaughter of
      animals (including other men), they have often attempted to justify
      their acts by attributing the most vicious or revolting qualities to
      those they would destroy, and the less reason there is for the
      slaughter, the greater campaign of vilification.

  Regardless of how much of this book is fiction and how much is based
  on fact, it's well worth reading.

As a farmer whose land currently hosts coyotes and a bear that have
killed calves I have some sympathy those who don't want them around.
