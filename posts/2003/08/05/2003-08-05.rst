+ `They Found Him Dead`, by Georgette Heyer.  Light but entertaining.

+ `Watery Grave`, by Bruce Alexander.  A Sir John Fielding mystery.

+ `Nightseer`, by Laurell K. Hamilton.  You can see in this, her first
  novel, a few of the themes that Hamilton developed much further in her
  Anita Blake novels.

+ `Dragon Blood`, by Patricia Briggs.  This novel and the first in this
  series, `Dragon Bones`, are enjoyable alternatives to the prolix sagas
  of Jordan and company.  Interesting characters, interesting situations.
