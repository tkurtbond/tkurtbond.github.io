Recent Reading
--------------
+ `Blind Justice`, by Bruce Alexander. A Sir John Fielding mystery.

+ `Biblioholism: The Literary Addition`, by Tom Raahe.  Full of
  interesting bits of information.

For some reason, I've always been amused by the accidental
juxtiposition in the Dewey Decimal system that places near to each
other computer books and books by Erich Von Däniken, author of
`Chariots of the Gods`.  And then when I figured out why some people
refered to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay as “Chariots of the Frogs” I was
even more amused.
