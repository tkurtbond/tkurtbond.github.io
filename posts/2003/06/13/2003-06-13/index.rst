+ `A Close Run Thing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0
  553380435/qid=1055508395/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-1186387-6855855?v=glanc
  e%26s=books>`__, by Allan Mallinson.  This novel of the British Cavalry
  at Waterloo approaches its subject more in the manner of Patrick
  O'Brian's :series:`Aubrey and Maturin` books than that of Bernard Cornwell's
  :series:`Richard Sharpe` books, and is a welcome entry into the field for that
  alone.  I don't think Mallison pulls this off as well as O'Brian did,
  but the books are still worth reading.
