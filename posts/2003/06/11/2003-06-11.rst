+ `Wreck of the River of Stars`, by Michael F. Flynn.
+ `Hell's Faire`, by John Ringo.
+ `March to the Stars`, by David Weber and John Ringo.
+ `Nameless Magery` and `Of Swords and Spells`, by Delia Marshall
  Turner.  These two books remind me in some ways of `Doris Piserchia
  <link://slug/doris-piserchia>`__'s books.
