`OpenRPG <http://www.openrpg.com/>`__ is a client server application
for playing table-top roleplaying games over the Internet.  It runs on
Windows, Mac OS X, and various other versions Unix.  It provides
interactive chat with integrated dice rolling, a simple map display,
game server browsing, and a tree-structured data organizer for
character sheets, setting information, adventures, and so forth.  It's
a bit rough around the edges, but it's certainly functional enough to
be useful.
