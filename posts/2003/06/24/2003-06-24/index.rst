Recent Reading
--------------

+ `Honorable Company` by Allan Mallinson.

+ `The Haunted Monastery` by Robert Hans Van Gulik.  This is one of
  Gulik's `Judge Dee <http://www.friesian.com/ross/dee.htm>`__
  mysteries, set in ancient China.  Very good.

+ `Ada 95: The Craft of Object-Oriented Programming` by John English,
  `online edition <http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/je/adacraft/>`__. A
  good introduction to Ada 95.

Computing: Ada
--------------

I've been looking at `GtkAda <http://libre.act-europe.fr/GtkAda/>`__,
an Ada binding for Gtk+.  It's pretty complete, and is portable between
Unix and MS Windows, with a MacOS X version in the works.  An
explanation__ of how to create
the environment for you'll need for using recent versions (Gtk+-2.2.x
based, from CVS) with recent versions of GCC under MS Windows is
available__.  (Update: a new
`binary release`__ makes
things much simpler.)
