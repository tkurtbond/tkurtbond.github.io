+ `The Light Ages` by Ian R. MacLeod.  Well written and interesting, but
  ultimately rather depressing.

+ `A Regimental Affair` by Allan Mallinson.

+ `Slayer's Handbook` for the `Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying
  Game <http://www.btvsrpg.com/>`__, from `Eden Studios
  <http://www.edenstudios.net/>`__.  Writers: C.J. Carella, Timothy S.
  Brannon, David F. Chapman.  Editors: M. Alexander Jurkat, David F.
  Chapman.   At 156 pages, this slick, color hardback is a little smaller
  than I'd like to have seen, but it's well written and full of useful
  ideas, especially for the Director who is looking for ideas for a new
  Series.  It has several good ideas for alternate Buffyverses.
