One of the things that I really enjoyed when I first started playing
roleplaying games was drawing maps: dungeons, towns, countries,
continents, and worlds.  Even if I had no plans to actually use them I
enjoyed drawing them.  I haven't done that for a long time, but
recently I found `AutoREALM <http://autorealm.sourceforge.net/>`__, a
GPLed Mapping Program.  It looks like fun; I think I'll go draw some
maps.
