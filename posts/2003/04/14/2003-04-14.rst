It is easier to create a consistent game world if it is not too
detailed, and it is arguably easier to start playing in such a world,
since each roleplaying game group will create their own vision of the
world with their own details, and will feel a greater connection to
the world and it's unfolding history.  However, if game play generates
additional detail (as opposed to simply generating new history) then
inconsitences can arise.  This is not a problem for gamers who don't
care about details at all, but most care at least a little about the
details: they don't want taverns to switch from one side of the river
to another, for instance.

When gaming in more detailed worlds, the gamers have to expend more
effort up front to work within the details: learning how `TÃ©kumel

`Lunar Empire <https://glorantha.fandom.com/wiki/Lunar_Empire>`__ of Glorantha, but the additional detail can add depth
to the roleplaying experience and can provide additional inspiration
for the game.  How can such detail be best presented to prevent the
gamer from becoming overloaded and turned away by the detail? Is it
possible to present things in such a way that there is as little up
front work for the gamer to start playing in a detailed world as an
undetailed world, and can the continuing effort of working within the
details be kept close to the level of effort required to play in an
undetailed world?
