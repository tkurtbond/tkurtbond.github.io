I think that one of the things that helps Patrick O'Brian's
:series:`Aubrey and Maturin` series transcend its genre is the
skillful embedding of the main character's lives in their world.  In
most Napoleonic-era-military genre fiction the characters are seen
through the events of their lives as members of the military
establishment.  For example, all of Rifleman Dodd's actions in
`Rifleman Dodd and the Gun` by C.S.  Forester concern his military
mission.  Aubrey and Maturin, however, often do things that are *not*
part of their military life: music, natural history, local politics,
and so forth, and places them in a wider scope than many characters
from the genre.
