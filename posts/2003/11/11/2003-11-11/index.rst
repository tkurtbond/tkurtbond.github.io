+ `The Shining Company`, by Rosemary Sutcliff, 1990, Recorded Books,
  1994, read by Ron Keith.  Based on `The Gododdin`, the earliest
  surviving North British poem, this is the story, seen through the eyes
  of a young shield bearer, of the British resistance in the 7th century
  to the Saxon invasion of North Britian.  As usual, Rosemary Sutcliff
  does an excellent job of bringing us back in time.  Ron Keith does a
  very good reading of the story.
