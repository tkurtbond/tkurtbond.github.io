Recent Viewing
--------------

+ `Titus <http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0120866/>`__, directed by
  Julie Taymor and starting Anthony Hopkins.  I watched this completely
  for the first time last night; I'd seen bits and pieces of it before.
  It's an odd, disturbing, and good adaptation of Shapespeare's play
  `Titus Andronicus`.
