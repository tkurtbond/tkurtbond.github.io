+ `Wildtrack`, by Bernard Cornwell.  One of his modern period nautical
  adventure novels, written early in his career.  Enjoyable.
+ `Quicksilver`, by Neal Stephenson.  Quirky and interesting historical
  exploring seventeenth century scientific thought and political
  intrigue; rather prolix, as one would expect from the ground it tries
  to cover.  Enjoyable to those who don't mind a big book.
+ `The Shadow of the Lion`, by Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint, and Dave
  Freer.  A very good, though demanding, historical fantasy of magic,
  religion, politics, and romance in a richly imagined Venice of an
  alternate 16th century.  While I am reminded to a certain degree of the
  Merovingian Nights shared-world anthologies (there were some close but
  not exact parallels) this is ultimately a very different story.
