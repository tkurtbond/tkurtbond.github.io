MS Windows and GTK+: DLL Hell
-----------------------------

I'm glad GTK+ was ported to Microsoft Windows.  I'm glad various open
source and free software projects are porting to Microsoft Windows
using GTK+.  I sure wish they could all agree on *one* binary runtime
distribution.  Or alway supply a package specific version of GTK+ so
that the application will always work, although that's admittedly
evil.



Recent Reading
--------------

+ `Kingdom River`, by Michell Smith, 2003.  A generation later sequel to
  `Snowfall` (which I haven't read), this book reads fine on its own.  Ok
  post-apocalyptic fiction that's smoother but less quirkily interesting
  than Robert Adams's earlier Horseclans novels, with some interesting
  characters.
