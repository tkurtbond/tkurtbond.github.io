+ `Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World`.  Inspired by the
  novels by Patrick O'Brian, directed by Peter Weir, screenplay by Peter
  Weir and John Collee.  This is a good movie, providing a vivid and
  realistic depiction of life on board a frigate in the British Royal
  Navy of the Napoleonic era, and that is its primary merit.  Although it
  is not based on any one of the novels directly, drawing on events from
  several novels, the resulting story is reasonable, and reasonably
  focused.  The movie does capture to some degree the relationship
  between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, but it is less successful
  here, since most of the formative events in their friendship take
  place long before the movie starts, and would take too much time to
  explore in full.

  In the end, I think :series:`Aubrey and Maturin` would have been
  better served by a film of the the book `Master and Commander`.
