+ `Paladin of Souls`, by Lois McMaster Bujold.  A indirect sequel to her
  `Curse of Chalion`, this book main character is a minor character in
  the previous book.  Well written fantasy of the non-generic sort.
+ `The Far Side of the Stars`, by David Drake.  This is the third book
  in Drake's RCN series featuring Lt. Daniel Leary and Signals Officer
  Adele Mundy.  Well done military science fiction, with potential to be
  more.
