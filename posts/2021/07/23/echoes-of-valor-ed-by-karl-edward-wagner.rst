   My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4130228600">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
   Excellent collection of what I've read Wagner prefered to call heroic fantasy, but which is often called sword & sorcery. I had already read Howard's "The Black Stranger", first in its rewritten version ad a pirate story, "Swords of the Red Brotherhood", with Conan replaced with Howard's swashbuckling hero Black Vulmea, and later in its original form in the Del Rey trade paperback collection <i>The Conquering Sword of Conan</i>, but it was good to read it again. I was also familiar with Leiber's "Adept's Gambit", and enjoyed rereading it as well. Kuttner's "Wet Magic" was new to me, and I liked it, though not as well as the Howard and Leiber stories.
