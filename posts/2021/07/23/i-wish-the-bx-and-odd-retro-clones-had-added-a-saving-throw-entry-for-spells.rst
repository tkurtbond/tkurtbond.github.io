One simple improvement on B/X D&D and OD&D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I'd wished
that the B/X and OD&D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions was like that of AD&D.  Basic
Fantasy, Labyrinth Lord/Advanced Edition Companion, Old-School
Essentials, and Sword & Wizardry Complete and Core all fail to do
this.  As it is, you have to read the spell description to figure out
if a saving throw is allowed and what it means.

I'm **really** surprised that Old-School Essentials didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.

Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.
