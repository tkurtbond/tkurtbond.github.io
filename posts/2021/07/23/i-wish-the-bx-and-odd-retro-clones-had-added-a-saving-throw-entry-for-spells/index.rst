One simple improvement on B/X D&D and OD&D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I've wished
that the B/X and OD&D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions, like that of AD&D.  As it
is, you have to read the spell description to figure out if a saving
throw is allowed and what it means.

`Basic Fantasy`; `Labyrinth Lord` and `Advanced Edition Companion`;
`Old-School Essentials` `Classic Fantasy` and `Advanced Fantasy`;
`Sword & Wizardry Complete`, `Core`, and `Whitebox`; and `Delving
Deeper`, all fail to do this.

I'm **really** surprised that `Old-School Essentials` didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.

Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.
