I liked that one of the example characters in Dungeoneer_, Axel Wolfric
(who in my game was played by L.B. as Alexa Wolfrica), has several
abilities which mechanically are spells, but which the character
doesn't regard as magic, something they regard as evil.  Doing this
sort of thing in a fantasy game makes a lot of sense, where characters
might have weird one-off abilities.

And I really liked the trade paperback format, and found it convenient
at the table.
