I just noticed that `S'mon`_ responded_ on his blog_ to my question as
to if he had ever written an retrospective on his Mini Six Primeval
Thule campaign.  Neat!  He played a 28 session campaign with 3â€“5
Character Points per session and he was happy with the results.  I
thought he had some interesting thoughts on the game.  Go read it_!
