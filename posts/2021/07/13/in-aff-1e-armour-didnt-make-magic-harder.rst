Going back_ to Axel Wolfric, one of the example characters for
Advanced Fighting Fantasy 1\ :sup:`st` Edition, he has spells
despite being a sorcery-hating barbarian.  This works in AFF 1E
because **every** Hero and adversary is assumed to be wearing
appropriate armour.  If they *remove* their armour then all rolls on
the Damage Table against them adds 2 to the roll.  (See `Dungeoner`,
p. 163 and 164.  That's also where it talks about shields.)  So any
character can put points into the *Magic* Special Skill (at the cost
of reducing their SKILL characteristic by an equal amount), so anybody
can have magic.

I've always liked fantasy RPG systems where anybody can cast spells.
(Thanks, `DragonQuest`!)

Unfortunately, this doesn't work as well in Advanced Fighting Fantasy
2\ :sup:`nd` Edition.  AFF 2E allows anybody to put points into the
MAGIC characteristic (similarly reducing the number of points that can
be allocated to other characteristics), but casting spells in armour
requires additional magic points, the better the armour the more magic
points must be spent.  (See `Advanced Fighting Fantasy`, 2\ :sup:`nd`
Edition, p. 72, bottom of the 1\ :sup:`st` column and the top of the
2\ :sup:`nd` column.)

I wonder how much it would affect things in a game if I just ignored
that rule?  I'll have to try it sometime.

Later

Of course, that takes away some from the users of Sorcery in AFF 2E,
who spend STAMINA instead of MAGIC POINTS to cast a completely
different set of spells than Wizardry, *and* can cast in armour.
Hmm.  I'll have to think about it.
