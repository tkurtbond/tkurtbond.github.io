Wow, I didn't realize that monks in OD&D and AD&D 1E can't use
potions!  (And scrolls, but that didn't surprise me.)  OD&D states it
explicitly on page 3 of `Blackmoor`.  AD&D 1E doesn't state it
explicitly, but they are not among the allowed magic items listed
(appropriate weapons, rings, and miscellaneous magic that can be used
by theives) and it says all other magic items are **not** allowed.

I have do not know if this is how we played AD&D 1E back in the day.
I have a sneaking suspicion that we missed this restriction, but I
just don't know.

It was `Swords & Wizardry Complete` that clued me into this, as I was
comparing the monk class in it with AD&D 1E, and then I confirmed it
in OD&D.

There are so *many* differences among all the editions of pre-3E D&D!
Some are quite subtle, but really change how things play: no healing
potions for monks!
