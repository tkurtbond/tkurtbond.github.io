[I actually finished reading this back on July 9, 2021, but forgot to
finish this post, so it is appearing now.]

I finished reading the `Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome` from cover to cover and I am very impressed.

As I say in my terse Goodreads review:

   My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
   Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert D&D (B/X D&D) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.

To expand on this:

I've said elsewhere_ that I started playing with first edition AD&D.
As far as I can remember, we often simplified things: I don't remember
using segments, spell components, weapon speed factors, or armor class
adjustments, and I'm not sure we used anything like the actual
official combat sequence.\ [#addict]_ I never picked up the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert Sets, unfortunately, since I foolishly
thought “Advanced” meant better than “Basic”.

I think `Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy` is an wonderful way
for someone to learn the rules of classic D&D, and for running classic
D&D campaigns.  I wish it had been around when I started playing D&D.
I'd recommend it today for anyone learning to play, or anyone who
prefers the classic rules.

   See DMG p. 61, “Encounters, Combat, and Initiative”.

   It takes a 20 page document, `Advanced Dungeons & Dragons®
   Initiative and Combat Table`, compiled by David M. Prata, (I1_ or
   I2_) to come anywhere near compiling and explaining the actual
   first edition AD&D initiative and combat sequence.

   I'm not entirely convinced that there **is** a completely
   consistent interpretation of the rules, but people have spent a lot
   of time and effort trying to figure one out.
