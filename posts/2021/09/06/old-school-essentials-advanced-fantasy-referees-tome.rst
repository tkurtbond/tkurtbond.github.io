   This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&D.<br /><br />As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)<br /><br />I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&D.

`Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy` would probably be my first
choice for any new D&D campaign I start, all other things being equal.
