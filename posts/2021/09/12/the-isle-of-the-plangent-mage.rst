   My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4234102437">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
   This is an interesting adventure intertwining the sea, its creatures, and music. It describes a small area of coast with a village and inhabitants, a nearby island with several interesting locations, some inhabitants, and a dungeon with a good mix of monsters and interesting devices.<br /><br />Another very good adventure from Necrotic Gnome.
