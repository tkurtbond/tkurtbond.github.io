For reference: The only place I've been able to find the PDF of Ted
Harding's “A Guide to Typesetting Mathematics using GNU eqn” (the link
from troff.org is broken) is in the archives_ of the groff mailing
list and archive.org (search_ for “eqnguide”, since the file is named
``eqnguide.pdf``):

The last was the most recent I found, labeled *“Last Revised 27
October 2013”*.  It is also available from `archive.org`_.
