   My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4174428524">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
   Another excellent adventure from Gavin Norman. It even can be hooked up Hole in the Oak, an earlier adventure from him. It uses the same design as Hole in the Oak, where bolding and bullet points call attention to important points in the order you generally need them. This adventure improves on Hole in the Wall by including the relevant portion of the map on each two page spread describing the locations. Very well done.
