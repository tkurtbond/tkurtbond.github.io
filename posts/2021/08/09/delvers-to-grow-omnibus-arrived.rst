My copy of the `Delvers to Grow Omnibus` written by Kevin Smith and
produced by `Gaming Ballistic`_ arrived today.  It is a book to help
folks quickly make characters for `Steve Jackson Games`_\'s `Dungeon
Fantasy Roleplaying Game`_, a “Powered by GURPS” dungeon crawling
fantasy game.

Anyway, I've read it and it looks very useful.

I really want to run a Dungeon Fantasy RPG campaign with this and all
the other stuff that Gaming Ballistic's Douglas H. Cole has produced
for his Nordlond campaign setting.
