When I'm preparing for a session using any of the D6 System RPGs
(`Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game`__, OpenD6_, *Mini Six* (MS1_, MS2_)
or any of the many others) I like to use the following two charts to
set the difficulties for tasks.

      ===============  ========  ===============================================
      Difficulty       Target #  Description
      ===============  ========  ===============================================
      Very Easy        2−5       Nearly everyone can do it.  These checks should
                                 only be made if a success is critical to the
                                 scenario at hand. 
      Easy             6−10      Player characters will seldom have trouble with
                                 these tasks, but an untrained individual may
                                 find them challenging.
      Moderate         11−15     Average Characters have a reasonable chance of
                                 failing at this level.  Consistent success
                                 often requires training in the skill or a high
                                 level of natural ability.
      Difficult        16−20     Tasks at this level are truly challenging.  To
                                 succeed, a character needs to be well skilled
                                 or very lucky.
      Very Difficult   21−30     Challenges of this level fall into the domain
                                 of masters in the skill being used; few others
                                 will succeed at them.
      Heroic           31+       These challenges are almost impossible.  Only
                                 the very lucky or true masters can consistently
                                 succeed at them.

8½x11 inch Letter paper) , and the ConTeXt_ source_.  You can always
look at the ReStructuredText_ source of this page - there
should be link named "Source" at the beginning of this post if you are
