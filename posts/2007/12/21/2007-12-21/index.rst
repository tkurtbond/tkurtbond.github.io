+ *The Devil Wives of Li Fong*, by E. Hoffmann Price, copyright 1979;
  Del Rey/Ballantine Books. 
+ *The Jade Enchantress*, by E. Hoffmann
  Price, copyright 1982; Del Rey/Ballantine Books. 


E. Hoffmann Price, according to the blurbs in these two books, sold
his first fiction in 1924 and was writing full time by 1932, wrote
fantasy and non-fantasy alike, and knew many of the greats of the Pulp
Era. It is interesting to see that he was still writing books into the
1980s. These two, the first things I remember reading by Price (thank
goodness for Internet bookstores!), are enjoyable Chinese
fantasies. Well worth reading.

I haven't been keeping track of the books I've been reading for some
time, alas. I hope to be able to get back to it soon. I may try to
list at least some of the books that I read during the interim, but
when that happens I'll probably list them in a page to themselves,
rather than as part of this log. Say, maybe, `here
