Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the spring floods have arrived.  This morning when I went out to
drive to work there was water over Jesse Run Road at the mouth of Clay
Lick, a few hundred feet east from my driveway.  As I drove west down
Jesse Run Road, I could see water was over the Co Hwy 8/4, which leads
to Stretch Run, another alternate route off Jesse Run.  When I got to
the end of Jesse Run Road, water was up over the road, at least a foot
deep.  I pulled off the road to turn around, but got too far off and
got stuck in a little ditch.  Luckily the folks who live at the end of
Jesse Run, and a couple of other motorists came over and pushed me
out.  So, I'm back a home now, and it doesn't look like I'll be going
anywhere for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>floods</category><category>local</category><category>weather</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/05/04/the-spring-floods-have-arrived/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2009 14:18:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
