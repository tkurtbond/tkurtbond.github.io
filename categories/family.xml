&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Farming As I Have Known It: 60 Years in Central Appalachia&lt;/cite&gt;, by
S. Thomas Bond, copyright 2007; first edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, on farming and farm life, was written by my father over
10 years in his spare time, and is an absolutely fascinating look at
farming from the era of my great-grandparents and grandparents
through to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I grew up on a working farm and spent most of my time
before I graduated from college working on it, I was never as deeply
involved with farming as my father, something I now regret deeply.
This book gives a very good idea of the determination, hard work and
deep thought required to build and keep a family farm in West
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad had copies of this printed and some of them were Christmas
presents for us for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is available on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lhfwv.com/book/"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The kids I game with get mentioned a lot.  Right now they're my
daughter and niece and nephews.  I'm really lucky to have such a great
bunch of kids around to play games.  (Some of the parents game
occasionally, and I'm glad to include them in the games, any time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="simple"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;L.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother C.P.B. and his wife C.B. live about an hour away, so their
kids get to play semi-regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;B.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the oldest of the bunch, which means I've been experimenting on
him the longest.  (&lt;img alt="(:-)" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 2ex;"&gt; I hope it hasn't hurt too
much. &lt;img alt="(:-)" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 2ex;"&gt;) His first game was a &lt;cite&gt;FUDGE&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bunnies and Burrows&lt;/cite&gt;
game; I think he was 5 years old then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's married and off to college now, so we don't get to game
together as much any more, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;D.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the middle brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;M.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the youngest child, and started playing well below reading age,
so usually plays as part of a team with his dad or an older brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister C.I.A. and her husband J.W.A.II and their kids live on the
family farm, next door to me, so I get to run games for the A. kids,
along with my daughter, the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="simple"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;T.A.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the oldest boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;E.A.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is his younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;M.A.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is their younger brother and is the youngest of my regular gamers.
He can read now, and lots of fun playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;C.A.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the new baby boy, and he &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2011/09/24/ff-tirpg-shaggradds-hives-of-peril-play-session-1/"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; started playing in our
games.  He's very young yet, but seems to be having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother N.A.B. and his wife K.B–B. live far out of state, and so
their kids only get to play on summer and winter vacations when they
come and visit the family farm, but I enjoy running games for them
when they are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="simple"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;T.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is N.A.B.'s oldest son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;O.B.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;is his younger brother, and started with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games-played-with-the-kids/#buggin"&gt;Buggin'&lt;/a&gt;, but now
plays &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try online gaming with a map tool and either a chat
inteface or a voice interface when the kids are a little bit older, so
the ones that are farther away can get to play more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've run a lot of games for the kids; &lt;em&gt;Fudge Bunnies and Burrows&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;BESM Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Toon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Buggin'&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and perhaps
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- This one is just the local version of the one above, for testing. --&gt;
