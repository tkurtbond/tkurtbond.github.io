&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Double Adventure 1: Shadows &amp;amp; Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt;, by Marc W. Miller;

Product #312.  Art on page 19 by Liz Danforth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how these adventures differ from current
adventure design.  Both of these adventures present a location with
details about its contents, and give a way that a group of player
characters might get involved.  One of the adventures gives a page
of historical background of the location for the GM, although the
background doesn't directly affect play.  The other gives no history
at all, other than what can be gleaned from observing the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in commercial RPG adventure design has been to deliver
more and more detail for the GM, culminating in the current D&amp;amp;D
adventure format that attempts to provide, on a two-page spread,
absolutely everything that a DM has to have to run a tactical
encounter, from the tactical map to the exact details of each and
every NPC involved, so that the DM doesn't have to look anything up.
Moreover, in many modules, perhaps starting with the &lt;cite&gt;Dragonlance&lt;/cite&gt;
modules in the 1980s, there is a story supplied, which the player
characters are expected, more or less, to follow and figure out, and
some more-or-less obvious goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; certainly don't supply a pre-built story —
any story will be generated by the referee and players at the gaming
table, with possibly some pre-game activity by the referee while
reading the adventure beforehand.  And there are no obvious goals,
just situations to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually find this rather liberating, compared to the more
detailed adventures that are more common today.  There is something
about the things that aren't there in &lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; that
fires up my imagination and draws me into the situation.  It's
probably the same sort of thing that makes me see the original
&lt;cite&gt;Greyhawk&lt;/cite&gt; folio as more interesting that the later &lt;cite&gt;Living Greyhawk
Gazetteer&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention Liz Danforth in the info about the book above because ever
since I ran across her art in 5th edition &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; I've
enjoyed it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the physical design of the Classic Traveller books.  The 8½×5½
stapled booklet is just the right size, physically, to read easily and
carry around, and it opens and lays flat, for easy reference.  As far
as the information content, the physical constraints of the format
provides enough physical space to present a comprehensible amount of
information, without enough the temptation to pad the content with
irrelevancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like visual appearance of these books: the black covers of the
original books — with white text for the book title and subtitle, and red
text and a thick red line for the game title and publisher — were
stark, attractive, and stand out even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gather, from comments from Steve Jackson Games, on the comic-book
sized booklets they printed for the &lt;em&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/em&gt; line in the
early 2000s, that books of these form factors aren't cost effective
for traditional RPG publishers any more.  That's a pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>classic traveller</category><category>design</category><category>econimcs of rpgs</category><category>gaming</category><category>physical</category><category>rpg</category><category>traveller</category><category>visual</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/05/02/classic-traveller-just-the-right-size/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2009 16:30:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
