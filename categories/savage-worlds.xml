Edition&lt;/a&gt; (SWADE) is that it fixed spears so that you can use them
one-handed, but only get bonus to parry if you use both hands.  In
&lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition&lt;/cite&gt; (SWD) and earlier editions spears could
only be used two-handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Str+d6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parry +1, Reach 1, 2 hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWADE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Str+d6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach 1. Parry +1 if used two-handed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows the historical “Spear and Shield” combat style.
See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XuhoFszfe8"&gt;Lindybeige&lt;/a&gt; for why this matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe something similar should have been done with Staff as well,
changing it so it can be used one-handed but losing the “Parry +1” in
that case.  Maybe not, since a staff depends on strength for more of
its damage than the mostly piercing spear.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started playing with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E (in 1979 or 1980) we didn't use
miniatures or battle maps, it was all theater of the mind.  Since all
the players I knew personally started with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; none of us had seen
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"&gt;Chainmail&lt;/a&gt; or played miniatures games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved on to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd edition, (in the mid 1980s) where
a hex grid and miniatures was required, I bought a Chessex hex grid
Megamat and wet erase markers.  One of my brothers had bought a box of
miniatures (though for the life of me I cannot remember what company
it was from or what figures it contained).  We used those for player
characters.  For monsters, I cut out a bunch of ¾ inch square blocks
of wood and numbered them on the top side, put a “D” for Dead on the
bottom side, put an “S” on another smooth side for Stunned, and a “U”
for Unconscious, leaving the rough sides (where the wood was cut
against the grain) blank.  I continued to use all these when I moved
over to using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 3rd edition, which also had specific Stunned and
and Unconscious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later I got the Steve Jackson Games Cardboard Heroes but
never could bear to cut them up, since I wasn't actively playing at
the time it came out (1999 or so?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; again with 3.5E (probably sometime
after 2004) I mostly played and didn't DM.  I was fortunate that the
DMs that I played with had good collections of pre-painted plastic
miniatures for both player characters and monsters from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Miniatures_Game"&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&lt;/a&gt;.  I did collect some of the Dungeon Tiles
(see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Tiles"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/a-complete-list-and-gallery-of-dungeon-tiles-sets/"&gt;dmdavid&lt;/a&gt;) that Wizards of the Coast published
during this time. (I actually used them playing Savage Worlds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one campaign that I DMed with 3.5E I bought an Flip Chart/Easel
Pad printed with a 1 inch grid.  I would take several sheets to the
game in a tubular storage container and draw the rooms on the map with
black marker as the players explored.  If we ran off the the side of a
sheet or went to a new level I'd get out another sheet and draw on
that.  This worked surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One GM had a fair bit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dwarvenforge.com/"&gt;Dwarven Forge&lt;/a&gt; terrain and that was a lot
of fun to play on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (around 2005) I did a lot of
GMing, and was thrilled by the Figure Flats and map tiles that that
Great White Games (now known again as Pinnacle Entertainment Group —
PEG) included in many of their Savage Tales PDF adventures.  I had a
printer that could print on card stock, so these were ideal for
me.  Later PEG products, such as their Plot Point campaigns, often had
Figure Flats as separate PDF accessories.  I found them all very
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/51074/eAdventure-Tiles-Introductory-Set"&gt;e-Adventure Tiles&lt;/a&gt; series from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/80/SkeletonKey-Games"&gt;SkeletonKey Games&lt;/a&gt;
very useful.  These &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Geomorphic_Map_Tiles"&gt;geomorphic map tiles&lt;/a&gt; are 6×6 inch squares, marked
with a 1 inch square grid, and by printing them out and putting them
together you can produce an infinite variety of maps.  I found them
most useful when printed on cardstock and labeled on the back with
their id number.  I'd make up several maps and then sort out the
printed tiles for that map into a manila envelope for easy
retrieval. There used to be a program that you could use the small
preview images from the tiles (which were considerately set up for
easy Copy and Paste from the PDF) to lay out your map at the small
scale and then print it for reference when later putting together the
large tiles. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#tiamat" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I'd include those in the manila envelope with
the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/667/Arion-Games"&gt;Arion Games&lt;/a&gt; and Disposable Heroes
paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27"&gt;Precis Intermedia&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147348073/Paper-Wars---Dragon-Pass-at-War"&gt;Paper Wars -
Dragon Pass at War&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Glorantha paper miniatures
published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgpublisher/10024/unspoken-word"&gt;The Unspoken Word&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to have been drawn by
Simon Bray, Dario Corallo, and Sarah Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the early paper miniatures that I used were tri-fold and were
cut out, folded, and glued (or taped) together.  They usually had
front sides in color and a back side in black and white.
Unfortunately, these take up almost as much room as lead or plastic
miniatures, though were much lighter to carry.  I stored them in cheap
plastic food containers, which let me easily see what was inside them.
Carrying enough of them to games outside my home was a bulky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved to A-frame paper miniatures, where there are two
sides and they are attached at the top, with tabs that fold out or in
at the bottom for a base.  Instead of relying on the tabs to form the
base, I used plastic &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27_96"&gt;stands&lt;/a&gt; from Precis Intermedia, where you'd just
fold the miniature once and stick it in the stand.  The stands add a bit
of weight to the miniatures and make them much more stable.  If you
cut out a front that is attached to a back, instead of all three
sides, you can just fold them once and stick them in a stand as well,
so I could use all my trifold paper miniatures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zenseeker.net/PaperMiniatures/DIY.htm"&gt;Zen DIY Paper Miniatures Page&lt;/a&gt; has some pictures of A-frame and
trifold paper miniatures.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these paper miniatures are flat when not inserted into stands I
currently organize my paper miniatures into separate small manila
envelopes for each type of creature, labeled with the creature type on
the outside.  Occasionally I use small ziplock bags, especially for
the PCs' miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper miniatures described above are all drawn in such a way that
the figure is drawn within a rectangle and you can cut them out with
long straight cuts and cross cuts.  There is another style of paper
miniatures drawn in a manner so that you cut out the irregular outline
of the figure itself with many small or curving cuts.  These are much
harder to cut out, and are more difficult to store, but are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
impressive to look at.  (You can see some examples in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/monsters.html"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;
collection at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/"&gt;One Monk Miniatures&lt;/a&gt;) That's too much work for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a Steel Sqwire Flip Mat, which uses dry erase pens, and it
is 24×30 inches and folds up into an 8×10 inch package only a ¼ inch
thick or so.  Much easier to carry around, since it fits into the same
backpack or messenger bag I use to carry my RPG books and
accessories. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#accessories" id="id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; More over, unlike the ones you can find
now published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8oto?GameMastery-FlipMat-Basic"&gt;Paizo&lt;/a&gt;, it had both 1 inch squares and 1 inch hexes,
perfect for DragonQuest, GURPS, or The Fantasy Trip, though I've used
mostly the squared side, for Savage Worlds.  The dry erase pens are
much more satisfactory than the wet erase pens.  For some time I
haven't had extra time to lay out locations using paper map tiles, and
the Flip Mat lets me quickly draw out locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually use miniatures and a battle map for Savage Worlds
there have been several occasions where I've run games in theater of
the mind style, without any miniatures or battle map.  It takes a
little adapting, but isn't that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current practice is to use paper miniatures in stands for player
characters and numbered blocks for opponents, with a Flip Mat as the
battle map.  Some times for opponents that take up more than one
square I'll fold over or cut up a 3×5 or 4×6 card and use that,
writing an arrow to indicate which way is the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/melee/"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/wizard/"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; style counters, which lie flat on
the table, but I got in on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-legacy-edition/"&gt;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/the-fantasy-trip-old-school-roleplaying"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and am intending to try them out sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when running &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision"&gt;B/X D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; there of
(like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goblinoidgames.com/"&gt;Goblinoid Games&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord"&gt;L1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/760/Goblinoid-Games/subcategory/2033_6311/Labyrinth-Lord"&gt;L2&lt;/a&gt;), it's &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
inspired &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/a&gt;, or the book that squashes them
together: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259983/Advanced-Labyrinth-Lord-Dragon-Cover?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt;, or like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/"&gt;Necrotic Gnome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials"&gt;Old
School Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/"&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;) it's often theater of the
mind: no miniatures, no battle map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tiamat"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program that I used was a desktop application rather
than a web-based application, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgobjects.com/index.php?c=tiamat"&gt;Tiamat the Tile Mapper&lt;/a&gt; is a
similar application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice of course; usually I carry a couple of extra
sets for when someone forgets their dice.  For Savage Worlds I
carry several differently colored sets of glass beads (stored in
small ziplock bags). I use blue beads for bennies, white beads for
GM bennies, red beads for wounds, yellow beads for shaken and white
beads again for fatigue.  I've found it helps the players (and
myself) to remember their status if they have physical objects
sitting on their character sheet to remind them.  When playing with
numbered blocks for opponents I put the shaken bead on top of the
block; this really helps when I've got 30 opponents on the table.
I carry a couple of decks of playing cards for Savage Worlds
initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4541318/Roman-sling-bullets-deadly-44-Magnum.html?fbclid=IwAR2IZhVYW4-4_BcuQDOq2yGXwwurzBd3HNSo1BzN7XUwZLKHF4XZ54yy0VU"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, headlined “Roman sling bullets
used against Scottish tribes 2,000 years ago were as deadly as a .44
Magnum”, I was thinking about slings in RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often thought that sling bullets are woefully nerfed in many
RPGs, especially D&amp;amp;D.  In D&amp;amp;D 5E, for instance, they're only 1d4,
while a short bow is 1d6 and a long bow is 1d8. For comparison,
daggers are 1d4 and longswords are 1d8.  In OD&amp;amp;D using Greyhawk's
“Damage Done by Weapon Type” table sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; are 1d4, and the
same in B/X D&amp;amp;D's optional “Variable Weapon Damage” table.  However,
in 3-book OD&amp;amp;D and B/X D&amp;amp;D without the “Variable Weapon Damage” table
all weapons did 1d6 damage, so slings weren't nerfed there.  AD&amp;amp;D 1E
has sling &lt;em&gt;bullets&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4+1 vs. Size Small or Medium and 1d6+1
vs. Size Large.  Sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; are 1d4 vs. Size Small, Medium or
Large.  Compare that to arrows at 1d6 vs. Size Small, Medium, or
Large.  But all bows fire twice per round, so they can be doing up to
2d6 per round.  Interestingly, heavy quarrels are 1d4+1 vs. Size Small
or Medium, and 1d6+1 vs. Size Large with the heavy crossbow firing
once in two rounds, while light quarrels are 1d4 vs. all three sizes
and fire every round.  So, nerfed once you take into rates of fire.
D&amp;amp;D 3.5E has sling bullets as 1d4, while longbows are 1d8 and heavy
repeating crossbows are 1d10 and light repeating crossbows are 1d8.
Definitely nerfed.  In D&amp;amp;D 4E slings are 1d6, while longbows are 1d10,
shortbows are 1d8, and a crossbow is 1d8.  There is even more
variability among editions of D&amp;amp;D than I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; slings are Str+d4, while a bow is 2d6.  For
comparison, a dagger is Str+d4 and a long sword is Str+d8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneQuest"&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt; 2E they are 1d8, similar to a Composite bow at 1d8+1
and broadsword at 1d8.  In Elric! (a member of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer_(role-playing_game)"&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/a&gt; line
of games, appearing between 4th Edition and 5th Edition, but the rules
were substantially equivalent to Stormbringer 5E; It is relative of
RuneQuest mechanically, part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; family
of games) a sling is 1d8+1, similar to a Desert Recurve Bow at 1d8+2,
and a broadsword at 1d8+1.  So in the BRP games they are not nerfed.
In DragonQuest their Damage Modifier is +1, while a dagger is +0, a
long bow is +4 and a broadsword is +4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talislanta"&gt;Talislanta&lt;/a&gt; 4E a sling's Damage Rating is 4, as is a dagger, while a
long bow and broadsword are 8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; 5E, sling damage is 1d6+1, same as a medium bow or a light
long bow, while a medium long bow is 1½ d6 (that's 1 and ½ d6)
and a heavy long bow is 2d6.  A dagger is 1d6-1 and a broadsword is
1d6+1.  Note that strong enough characters add damage to this based on
how strong they are. Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS#Prior_RPG_history"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 4E, damage is based on your strength, and the only dice used is
d6.  We'll use an average Strength 10 character as an example.  Their
Thrust damage is 1d-2 and their Swing damage is 1d. An opponent's
Damage Resistance (DR) is subtracted from the rolled damage and any
damage left is multiplied by a modifier for each type of damage.
Piercing damage has a ×1 modifier, cutting has a ×1.5 modifier, and
impaling has a ×2 modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sling damage is swing piercing, and the damage for that for our
average character is 1d.  A longbow is thrust+2 impaling. and the
damage for that is 1d, and whatever makes it past DR is doubled.  A
regular bow is thrust+1 impaling, and the damage for that is 1d+1
(minus DR) ×2.  A dagger is thrust-1 impaling, so that is 1d-3 (minus
DR) ×2.  A thrusting broadsword is swing+1 cutting (1d+1 (minus DR)
×1.5) or thrust+2 impaling (1d+2 (minus DR) ×2).  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that's
nerfed a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'd like to note that when actually playing GURPS I think this is
simpler to do at the table than it sounds like. The damage values for
each attack is figured out at character creation :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasy_Trip"&gt;The Fantasy Trip&lt;/a&gt;, which like GURPS only uses d6, slings do
1d-2, small bows do 1d-1, longbows do 1d+2, daggers do 1d-1, and
broadswords do 2d.  A little bit nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth"&gt;Big Eyes Small Mouth (BESM)&lt;/a&gt; 2nd Edition Revised, slings are not
listed, but a long bow does 5 damage, a longsword does 10 damage, and
a dagger does 5 damage.  In BESM 3rd Edition, an average person has an
Attack Combat Value (ACV) of 4 and a Damage Multiplier of 5.  Each weapon has
a Level, which is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier and added to the
ACV for the final damage.  Slings are Level 1 (1 × 5 + 4 = 9), as are
daggers.  Longbows are Level 3 (3 × 5 + 1 = 16), as are longswords.
Definitely nerfed.  (It is the same in &lt;cite&gt;BESM 4E&lt;/cite&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A2rnMaster"&gt;HarnMaster&lt;/a&gt;, weapon impact (damage) for Melee weapons has three
Aspects, Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A dagger's impact is B
1, E 2, P 5, while a broadsword is B 3, E 5, and P 3.  A Missile
weapon's impact depends on the type of missile weapon and the range:
short, medium, long, and extreme.  Slings are Short 4, Medium 3, Long
2, and Extreme 2.  Shortbows are Short 6, Medium 5, Long 4, Extreme 3.
Longbows are Short 8, Medium 8, Long 6, Extreme 5.  Nerfed.  I'll note
that these weapon or missile impacts are added to a Strike Impact is
decided by a table indexed by how well the attacker did on opposed
rolls of attack skill against the defender's skill in Block,
Counterstrike, Dodge, or if the defender ignored the attack. For Melee
attacks this can result in the defender having blocked the attack,
either the attacker or the defender fumbling or stumbling, the
defender gaining a Tactical Advantage (a free action), or either or
both having made a Strike, which generates from 1 to 4 d6s.  For
Missle attacks this can result in a Miss (with a chance to hit an
adjacent combatant, a Wild (a fumble roll), a Block, or a Strike,
which generates from 1 to 3 d6s.  The Armor Protection value is
subtracked and the result is the total Effective Impact, which is then
referenced on the Injury Table to determine where the on the body the
injury is and how serious it is.  There are no Hit Points like D&amp;amp;D or
Wounds like Savage Worlds.  Instead the character accumulates injuries
like “1 Minor Slash Left Upper Arm, 1 injury level”.  The total injury
level determines the difficulty of the character staying conscious and
penalty to any skill roll.  Some of the injuries may immediately kill
the injured character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good thread by Robert S. Conley (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batintheattic.blogspot.com/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.batintheattic.com/index.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/22847/robert-conley"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpgpub.com/threads/the-one-where-i-sing-the-praises-of-harnmaster.2363/"&gt;RPG PUB&lt;/a&gt;
that talks some more about HarnMaster combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In West End Games' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D6_Fantasy"&gt;D6 Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, attributes are measured in d6s and 2D
is an average human.  Bow and sling damage and melee damage as d6s
added to a number of d6s determined by your Strength Damage, which is
determined by your Physique attribute or Lifting skill (both measured
in d6s), drop any adds, divided by 2.  So our average human's Strength
Damage is 2D.  Then longbows add +2D+2, shortbows add +1D+2, and
slings add +1D.  For comparison, daggers add +1D and broad/long swords
ad +2D+2.  So, nerfed, although it is hard to make precise
distinctions at this level of resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls"&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/a&gt; only uses d6s and weapons are measured in “Dice +
Adds”, that is the number of d6s to roll and the number of points to
add to the dice total.  The common sling is 2d.  A very light self bow
is 2d, a light self bow is 3d, a medium self bow is 4d, a heavy self
bow is 5d, and a extra-heavy self bow is 6d.  These all have
increasing Strength Required to use the weapon.  For comparison, a
Dirk is 2D+1 and a broadsword is 3d+4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warriors"&gt;Dragon Warriors&lt;/a&gt; weapon damage has two parts: an armor
penetration die (measured in dice: d4, d6, d8, etc.) and damage
points.  The armor penetration die is rolled against the Armour Factor
of the defender's armour: a Gambeson has an Armour Factor of 2 while
Plate has an Armor Factor of 5, and the attacker has to roll &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt;
than the Armour Factor to inflict damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sling has Damage (d6, 3 points) while a Bow has Damage (d6, 4
points).  For comparison, a dagger has Damage (d4, 3 points) and a
sword has Damage (d8, 4 points).  Slightly nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I GM games that I think nerf slings, like D&amp;amp;D, I often use a
house rule that sling bullets are higher damage than sling stones, and
more similar to the damage of a short bow, 1d6, for example.  I may
have been underestimating them and should consider them closer to a
long bow, 1d8, as Chaosium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; variants
(RuneQuest, Elric, Stormbringer) do.&lt;/p&gt;

Imperium&lt;/cite&gt; (1979) has a section on bow weapons, on p. 16!  A sling does
2D wounds and a long bow does 2D wounds also.  For comparison, from
&lt;cite&gt;Book 01 Characters &amp;amp; Combat&lt;/cite&gt; (1981) on p. 47 on the “Range Table” (?)
dagger, blade, cutlass, and sword all do 2D wounds.  Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cepheus Engine&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/237247/Cepheus-Engine-RPG"&gt;C1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.paulelliottbooks.com/what-is-cepheus-engine.html"&gt;C2&lt;/a&gt;) doesn't have slings, but a bow is 2D6.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/304840/The-Sword-of-Cepheus"&gt;Sword of Cepheus&lt;/a&gt;, the fantasy variant, has sling as 2D, short bow
as 2D, long bow as 3D, dagger as 2D, and sword as 3D.  Maybe a little
nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, slings are a little nerfed.  I think I'll use a house rule that
says the sling damage in the book is for sling stones, and sling
bullets do the same damage as an arrow fired from a shortbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heard rumors of Cutthroat Henry Hobbs' treasure; key under Santa
Domingo's Lion's Gate (St. Leon's church).  Go there.  Try to climb
down well in church.  Rowena falls, but quietly.  Find box with sand
casting of key with the number 4 on the handle.  Took it to a
blacksmith, who recognizes it as a key from a gold collection site
from mines of Santa Domingo — he warns us that the spirits of natives
who died in the mines infest them to this day.  11$ to make the key.
Can't find any way to protect us from the spirits. Bought Lantern and
Bullseye Lantern and 6 pints of oil for 89$.  Went to mines.  5 main
passages.  Some men came out of one of the other passages.  Their
leader is Catfish Carlos Peña, and they say they can't let us get away
knowing about them.  We fire and kill Peña and others flee.  Number 4
area opens to our key.  Only thing of interest is the Shipping
Security Log.  The 13th shipment lists Robyn H Besh (an anagram for
Henry Hobbs) is in charge.  He must have changed the log and took
command of the ship to took it to Santiago (destination listed on the
log).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack has a one-masted sloop with 4 crew.  On the 3rd day one of the
crew sees a ship; 2 days later another crew member sees it.  We've
also been having bad luck.  We reach Santiago.  Lots of taverns to
investigate.  We find an old man, Smiling Jack, who sells us for 5$
the information that William Wilks sailed with Besh, boasted of
Spanish treasure, but lost money and couldn't pay.  Smiling Jack leads
us to the gambling house wher Wilks, known as Whistling Willy, is
playing.  He's about to be shot.  Captain Jack Savage walks up to the
shooter and shoots him first, killing him.  His friends weren't
happy.  We kill 3 more, and 1 runs.  Question Whistling Willy.
Cutthroat double-crossed his crew.  Willy had a pine box Besh gave him
that turned out to have a false-bottomed, with a treasure map.  It
looks like Besh hid the treasure on the Isle of Pines.  We head
there.  A day's trek inland.  Come to the location where think
Hobbs/Besh buried the treasure.  Find large pine with H.H. and an
arrow pointing down carved on it, but it's surrounded by fire ants!
Drove the ants out with burning oil.  Takes 3 hours to dig down to 6
large chests with 5000$ each.  Took us several days to transfer the
chests to the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs rescued Virginia Cotton from rowdy pirates.  (+1 Fame) They
escorted her to the Royal Crown Tavern.  Her contact, Knox (???), told
her that her dad Jebidiah was a pirate, to her shock, and that he'd
buried a pirate treasure then got captured, and is being held captive
at the house of Baron Pettigrew.  When Virginia tells him that she
knows nothing of the treasure, he grabs her and tells his two thugs to
attack.  We manage to down Knox and one of the thugs and the other
flees.  We take their weapons and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide to sneak into Pettigrew's mansion.  Virginia suggests we
have our ship ready to go, so Capt. Jack gives the orders.  We went to
the mansion after dark and snuck up to the back door.  Sneak into the
kitchen, dining room, through the hall past a maid, and found a
sleeping guard.  We tried to knock the guard out and failed, but
intimidated him and tied him up, got the keys from him, opened the
door and found Jebidiah.  We untied Jebidiah and snuck out with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agreed to split the treasure and headed off in the ship.  Jack
healed up.  We were trailed by another ship, but managed to give them
the slip.  We arrived at the island, but had to ride out a storm
offshore.  Then we took a longboat ashore, and dug up the treasure.
There were five chests, each containing 500$.  We distributed the
treasure, one chest each to Jebidiah, Virginia, our crew, Rowena, and
Capt. Jack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we were joined by I.MC. in his first ever roleplaying game
session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="actual-play"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a call on the communicator — &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt;, a friend of &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Stygian Veil&lt;/span&gt; from the old
days, has been an undercover spy, and has heard they took the
superhero &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Champion&lt;/span&gt;. and converted him to &lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt; has been looking for
him, but hasn't found him, but has heard that he might be activated
from the satellite and that his old pals have a mission to the
satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="power"&gt;Mind Controlled&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes four hours to get to the satellite.  We have 6 fusion missiles
and 3 sonic torpedoes for our Manta.  &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt;'s authority codes are a
couple of weeks old but should still work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="npc"&gt;Quillik&lt;/span&gt; will pose as &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt;'s bodyguard and will carry us through the
scanner in one of our traveling vials in his mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to sea underwater for five miles, then surface and head
up towards space.  In the atmosphere, a &lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; man of war questions us.
&lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt; knows that the satellite we're heading towards is Satellite 15 and
bluffs.  They decide they'll escort us through the fighting.  After
two hours we're through most of the fighting and the man of war sends
us the rest of the way with an escort.  In part thanks to the escort's
presence we're cleared to enter the satellite docks despite be
unscheduled.   Once they figure out it is &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt; on board they're very
respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="npc"&gt;Quillik&lt;/span&gt; sets off a partial alarm when he passes through the regular
scanner.  After a quick explanation from &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt; that &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Quillik&lt;/span&gt; had been
injured in a recent fight with Earthlings &lt;strong&gt;[???]&lt;/strong&gt; the guards go get a
hand scanner and it goes off around &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Quillik&lt;/span&gt;'s mouth.  The guards ask
him to open his mouth, which he does, but the vial carrying us pops
out and falls to the floor in front of the guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get out and one Super Fin uses &lt;span class="power"&gt;Force Control
(Maneuverable)&lt;/span&gt; on us.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt; wounds him. &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Anvil&lt;/span&gt; flees to a corner and
waves his arms about futilely and wibbles, as commanded by &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Stygian Veil&lt;/span&gt; using
&lt;span class="power"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Quillik&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; attack back, but do not succeed.
Some of us recognize the Super Fin as DeNeg, &lt;strong&gt;[¿¿¿Spelling???]&lt;/strong&gt; once
a superhero in the old days.  DeNeg uses &lt;span class="power"&gt;Force Control (Bind)&lt;/span&gt;
on &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Raum&lt;/span&gt;, who breaks it by becoming intangible.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt; attacks DeNeg,
hitting for 22 damage.  War Spheres are heard approaching and &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt;
throws DeNeg into War Spheres, destroying one.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; does suppressive
fire against the War Spheres, shaking several.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[¿¿¿Who was the other Super Fin??? I remember it was a villain. How
did we kill him???]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pc"&gt;Stygian Veil&lt;/span&gt; hears noises from the control center.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Mauler&lt;/span&gt; rushes in and smashes a War
Sphere so hard he spins and falls down afterward.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; moves in and
sees &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Pyros&lt;/span&gt;, who looks half-&lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; and part zombie.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; kills
&lt;span class="npc"&gt;Pyros&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Stygian Veil&lt;/span&gt; sends the “broadcast drone self destruct” command from
a terminal in the control center.  A warning message is issued:
“broadcast drone self destruct — Champion ultimatum enabled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find 4 technicians, and escape pod blasts off; it has life signs.
We convince the remaining 4 technicians to enter another escape pod
and we sabotage the reactor core then leave in our Manta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last ½ hour of our journey back to Earth we see Champion — the
strongest super hero of the leading super team before the invasion —
chasing our Manta.  He had been blasted by the &lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; during the
invasion and thought dead by most, but it turns out he had been
converted to a &lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; and set up as a deadman trap.  He hits our ship,
wrecking it, and then comes back to peel it open to attack us.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Raum&lt;/span&gt;
hits him.  &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; hits him with a gun and then his power, and kills him!
We get shrunk and let &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; fly us down to Earth.  The battle left us
right over Star City.  Our ship lands in Northpoint, on &lt;span class="org"&gt;SoCorp&lt;/span&gt;
(the elite &lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; police and &lt;span class="power"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/span&gt; force) headquarters
and destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="group"&gt;V'Sori&lt;/span&gt; ships are retreating as &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt; flies us down to near our old
hideout, since we don't want to attract attention to the new hideout.
Someone tries to &lt;span class="power"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pc"&gt;Force Caster&lt;/span&gt;, and when we land &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Dr. D&lt;/span&gt;
appears with &lt;span class="org"&gt;Neptune Guard&lt;/span&gt; and says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Repent!  Come over to me, or die!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="aftermath"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each PC each got &lt;strong&gt;+5 XP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.A.H. was planning that we'd have the big battle with &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Dr. D&lt;/span&gt; next time
(which should finish the campaign) and then we'd have one-shots until
January, when M.A.H. will run a &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D 4e&lt;/cite&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the players were talking and decided they wanted at least one
more episode so everybody could level before the big fight with &lt;span class="npc"&gt;Dr. D&lt;/span&gt;,
perhaps as a flashback, and M.A.H. said she'd see what she could do.&lt;/p&gt;
