Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The usual GM in my adult group wasn't available this month (for very
good reasons), so I ran the “Dead Men Tell No Tales” one sheet for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/"&gt;Pinnacle Entertainment Group&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/em&gt; based game &lt;em&gt;Pirates
of the Spanish Main&lt;/em&gt; for them.  I had a lot of fun, and the group
seemed to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>actual-play</category><category>pulp</category><category>rpg</category><category>savage worlds</category><category>wvhtf</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/12/18/dead-men-tell-no-tales-take-2/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2008 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eternal Nazi, Take 2</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/07/23/eternal-nazi-take-2/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got to run the “Eternal Nazi” one sheet for &lt;em&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/em&gt; again,
for adults this time, M.A.H and C.A.H from my adult group.  We did
character generation for a new D&amp;amp;D campaign with the regular GM, who
then had to leave.  After that I ran “Eternal Nazi”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It went ok, I guess.  It ran much longer this time, probably for
several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I added a new encounter to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the players had played &lt;em&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and
to complicate things they were each playing two characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not at my best.  (Too little sleep, too much stress elsewhere
in my life.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to run this for yet another group, so I'll discuss
the specifics of my changes to the adventure then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new maps did make things a little more interesting, although the
design of one did provide a great deal of advantage to the PCs.  I'll
have to rethink that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really sit down and come up with some better tactics for the
BBEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not at my best, so I kept forgetting the simplest things, and I
know I actually made a couple of serious errors with the rules. You'd
think that since I've been playing Savage Worlds for a while I would
remember.  In my defense, I was using a couple of sections of the
rules that I'd only used once before.  Still, I need to get more rest
before I GM something!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>actual-play</category><category>pulp</category><category>rpg</category><category>savage worlds</category><category>wvhtf</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/07/23/eternal-nazi-take-2/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2008 04:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
