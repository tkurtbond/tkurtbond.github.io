My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4234102437"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an interesting adventure intertwining the sea, its creatures, and music. It describes a small area of coast with a village and inhabitants, a nearby island with several interesting locations, some inhabitants, and a dungeon with a good mix of monsters and interesting devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another very good adventure from Necrotic Gnome.

finish this post, so it is appearing now.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading the &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome&lt;/cite&gt; from cover to cover and I am very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say in my terse Goodreads review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576056628l/49203328._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy"&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16187767.Gavin_Norman"&gt;Gavin Norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D (B/X D&amp;amp;D) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13454227-t-kurt"&gt;View all my reviews on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games/#how-i-got-started"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; that I started playing with first edition AD&amp;amp;D.
As far as I can remember, we often simplified things: I don't remember
using segments, spell components, weapon speed factors, or armor class
adjustments, and I'm not sure we used anything like the actual
official combat sequence.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#addict" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I never picked up the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert Sets, unfortunately, since I foolishly
thought “Advanced” meant better than “Basic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; is an wonderful way
for someone to learn the rules of classic D&amp;amp;D, and for running classic
D&amp;amp;D campaigns.  I wish it had been around when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.
I'd recommend it today for anyone learning to play, or anyone who
prefers the classic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- See DMG p. 61, “Encounters, Combat, and Initiative”. --&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="addict" role="note"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#footnote-reference-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules on Initiative on p. 62–63 of the Dungeon Master's Guide
(DMG) sound simple, but there are further elaborations elsewhere in
the DMG (“Simultaneous Initiative” on p. 66, for instance) and
other AD&amp;amp;D 1E rule books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a 20 page document, &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons®
Initiative and Combat Table&lt;/cite&gt;, compiled by David M. Prata, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://idiscepolidellamanticora.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/addict.pdf"&gt;I1&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://knights-n-knaves.com/dmprata/ADDICT.pdf"&gt;I2&lt;/a&gt;) to come anywhere near compiling and explaining the actual
first edition AD&amp;amp;D initiative and combat sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely convinced that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a completely
consistent interpretation of the rules, but people have spent a lot
of time and effort trying to figure one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's a brief but clear discussion of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Initiative
Controversy&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706181418/http://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; on archive.org) describing both The
A.D.D.I.C.T. Method and the OSRIC method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&amp;amp;D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; would probably be my first
choice for any new D&amp;amp;D campaign I start, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4056920456"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the classes, races, spells, and other player facing rules of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must admit I miss the monk, and the two Hit Dice at first level of the Ranger from AD&amp;amp;D 1E, but I suppose the former is out because of the common perception that it doesn't thematically fit the pseudo-medieval setting of most D&amp;amp;D games, and the latter is part of adapting to the scale of B/X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome is another excellent presentation of the classic rules in a well designed and sturdy hard back book. I'm impressed with the organization and clarity of the presentation. I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic player rules.

Another excellent adventure from Gavin Norman. It even can be hooked up Hole in the Oak, an earlier adventure from him. It uses the same design as Hole in the Oak, where bolding and bullet points call attention to important points in the order you generally need them. This adventure improves on Hole in the Wall by including the relevant portion of the map on each two page spread describing the locations. Very well done.

If you are looking for a way to customize existing classes or create new classes for B/X D&amp;amp;D style games, especially Old-School Essentials, this book is a wonderful resource. It breaks the original classes down into their fundamental parts and provides a simple system for building those parts into new or customized classes. It presents the breakdown for each of the original classes, then provides a list of class variants, customized versions of the original class, as well as sub-classes, heavily redesigned classes. For instance, for the Cleric, the class variants are: Cleric (Dead God), Cleric (God of Death), Cleric (God of Knowledge), Cleric (God of Life), Cleric (God of Nature), and Cleric (God of War); and the sub-classes are Crusader and Shaman. Class variants and sub-classes are presented for Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfling, Magic-User, and Thief. It also provides a version of Thief skills using the d6, other d6 skills that can be used in creating classes, some additional armour, weapons, and ammunition, an optional table for spell failure in appropriate circumstances (for example, when non-casters read a spell scroll), a table of special abilities gained by classes that have animal companions, differing depending on the animal in question, and options for characters to gain at high levels, beyond the limits of their level progression tables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll definitely be using this in my next B/X-style game!

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One simple improvement on B/X D&amp;amp;D and OD&amp;amp;D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I've wished
that the B/X and OD&amp;amp;D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions, like that of AD&amp;amp;D.  As it
is, you have to read the spell description to figure out if a saving
throw is allowed and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Basic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Core&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Whitebox&lt;/cite&gt;; and &lt;cite&gt;Delving
Deeper&lt;/cite&gt;, all fail to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; surprised that &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.&lt;/p&gt;
