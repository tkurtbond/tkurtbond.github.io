&lt;p&gt;I got an interesting game yesterday, and finished reading it today:
the 1991 &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings Adventure Game&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Crown_Enterprises"&gt;Iron Crown
Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first holder of the Tolkien franchise
for RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICE got its start with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolemaster"&gt;Rolemaster&lt;/a&gt;, which started as a detailed
add-on combat system for D&amp;amp;D and developed into a very detailed RPG of
its own, based on open-ended d100 rolls: high is good and on very
high or low rolls you roll again and add the new roll for high or
subtracted for low, continuing infinitely in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICE then got the Tolkien franchise and developed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing"&gt;Middle-Earth Role
Playing&lt;/a&gt; (MERP) as a slightly simplified RPG for those who wanted to
play in Middle Earth, but did not want all the complexities of the
full Rolemaster system.  The adventures were written in such a way that
you could play them either with Rolemaster or MERP, and had some short
guidelines to help the GM adapt them for other games.  They had a lot
of success and their Middle Earth products were extensive and highly
regarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of folk used them with other RPG systems.  (I bought several for
the ideas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in their run, ICE wanted to tap the larger Tolkien readership and
so wrote the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_Adventure_Game"&gt;Lord of the Ring Adventure Game&lt;/a&gt; as a much simpler
game that they hoped would draw interested readers and the viewers of
the animated Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have fond memories of the animated Hobbit, though I knew it only
through reading the graphic novel adaptation that used art from the
movie when I was at my uncle and aunt's place in New York one summer.
I finally saw it, probably on TV some years later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Lord of the Rings Adventure Game (LOR hereafter, as seems
to be customary) comes in a box with a 32 page rulebook, a 64 page
adventure with 6 pre-generated characters, a 32 pamphlet of 4 pages of
backstory for the 6 pregens and area maps for the adventure, several
poster sized maps, including a nice color one of Middle Earth, and
(missing in my copy, as the seller had noted in the description) 2
six-sided dice and a sheet of standup cardboard figures of people and
creatures and the pregens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters have 12 stats: 6 capabilities (Strength, Agility,
Intelligence, Movement, and Endurance) and 6 skills (Defense, Melee
Offensive Bonus, Ranged Offensive Bonus, General, Subterfuge,
Perception, and Magical).  The value of each of these is called a
bonus, and can be less than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pick one of 9 character types (Hobbit Scout, Elf Scout, Human
Warrior, Dwarf Warrior, Elf Warrior, Human Ranger, Half-elf Ranger,
Human Bard, and Elf Bard), which sets your equipment and capability
values and starting skill values, and then you have six +1 bonuses to
add to your skills as you choose, no more than +3 to any one skill.
If you have +1 or more in magic you get two spells per +1 bonus.  Some
of your equipment gives bonuses to your stats.  I'll note that your
character type doesn't restrict what you can do: if you want your
Warrior to be able to use magic, put some of your starting skill
bonuses into Magical!  And they don't really have much to do with what
your characters occupation is: someone who takes one of the Warrior
character types can be a merchant, someone who takes one of the Scout
character types can be a healer.  It is all in how you assign your
starting skill bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your character type sets your Endurance (basically your hit points),
with the dwarf warrior having the most at 60 points and the elf bard
the least at 30 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 15 spells, all with a fairly reasonable balance between
keeping with the magic seen in the novels, which is to say not
tremendously powerful, and what one would expect from a fantasy RPG.
The spells are Strength, Shield, Speed, Balance, Camouflage,
Concentration, Item Analysis, Clairvoyance, Healing, Luck, Protection
from Magic, Sustenance, Calm, Charm Animal, and Fire Bolt.  Magic
items typically add a plus to a stat, or let you do something you
couldn’t before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maneuvers are how you use your stats.  Some, like climbing a tree have
a set difficulty.  Others the GM sets the difficulty, from Routine (4)
to Absurd (18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You roll 2d6 plus a stat bonus versus a target number or an opponent’s
roll.  Meet or exceed an unopposed roll to succeed, while you can tie
on opposed rolls.  In combat you take the attacker’s Offensive Bonus
minus the defenders Defensive Bonus and roll 2d6 and look the result
up in a chart to see how much damage is done and whether the defender
is knocked unconscious or killed outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities are things that are normally automatically successful if
you have the equipment and time (tying up a captive, setting up camp,
digging a ditch), but turn into GM moderated maneuvers if you don’t
have the time or equipment (digging a ditch to hide in before the
opponents you want to ambush show up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 14 action sequences.  These things like combat (one of the
action sequences) where there is a general sequence you follow to do
something, from sneaking through a town at night to tracking through a
wilderness or ambushing an enemy.  I like how these are written up as
a standard sequence of things to do and consider, just like how combat
is done in most system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These action sequences can be adjusted by the GM for circumstances and
they encourage you to make up your own.  You might make one up for
when someone is wanting to convince a crowd of something.  They are
multi-step procedures for doing something.  I think they would be
quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get Experience Points (EP) for successful maneuvers depending on
how hard the target number was, for every point of damage inflicted,
with unconsciousness and killed results worth more, and for every
point of damage the caster of a spell takes to cast the spell.  (Every
spell costs the caster Damage to cast!). You also get EP for good
ideas and for the group accomplishing significant goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The included adventure is a mix of programmed sequences to help the
new GM and players learn the system, where the choices the players
make determines what section you turn to next, and the sections are
broken up into action sequences and the results determine which
section the players go to next, GM notes on how to run or adjust
things, and descriptions of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do notice that each of the pregens has a special ability: finding
lost items or people, eidetic memory, knowing if any creature within a
20 foot radius is aligned with forces of darkness, healing wounds
faster, being unusually skilled at bargaining and negotiation, and
always knowing which way is north and can follow known routes
perfectly.  But there is no rule for assigning these to characters.  I
imagine that if the GM wanted to have special abilities for other
characters the GM and the players should come up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules encourage you to use figures or counters to represent
characters in combat, and movement is given in inches, to be measured
on the map, if you draw one, or on the table if you just set out the
figures at the right distances.  You could easily use a battle map
with a grid, if you have one.  Movement at a walk is 50 feet plus 10
feet multiplied by the characters Movement bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I like it.  I hope to run it this year for Christmas, if all
goes well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a Wikipedia &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_Adventure_Game"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; about it, but it is even
briefer than this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a compatible game, The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/ambarquenta/home/the-offical-games/meag"&gt;Middle-Earth Adventure Game&lt;/a&gt;
(MEAG), that was designed by Brian Gross and J.R. Gracen.  I knew of
it before I got the LotRAG, it seems to be a generalization and
expansion, and thus a little more complicated, but it doesn't look
&lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; complicated.  I'll read it and report what I think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Dyskami Publishing’s &lt;em&gt;Demonicity&lt;/em&gt; tonight (&lt;a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369442/Demonicity-RolePlaying-Adventures-TriStat-System"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).  I liked the document design and found it easy to read, except the “Demon City” two page spread which I found a pain to read because of the body font.  I liked the artwork; it was not particularly anime or manga like, unlike &lt;em&gt;BESM Fourth Edition&lt;/em&gt;.  There were a few typos, missing words, and other minor mistakes, but there was only one that hindered comprehension, and that one I figured out eventually from the context.  The rules are easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting of &lt;em&gt;Demonicity&lt;/em&gt; is the titular “Demon City”, a city that is the location of an attack by demons from an different world/dimension.  It is obviously inspired by their earlier licensed RPG, &lt;em&gt;Demon City Shinjuku&lt;/em&gt;, which I quite liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demonicity&lt;/em&gt; has a very interesting stripped down version of the Tri-Stat system that makes character generation and play much simpler.  In some ways it reminds me of &lt;em&gt;BESM First Edition&lt;/em&gt;, though it is even simpler. The three Stats are Body, Mind, and Soul, of course, so that’s the same.  There are also Attributes, which are the special things a character can do.  Stats can be determined randomly or assigned by the player, and they and Attributes always cost points.  And there are some Derived Values: Combat, Health, Sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You roll 2d6 and add a stat or a derived value (like Combat), plus optionally an Attribue’s level, and compare the result to a target number or an opposed roll.  Things that make something easier are Edges: you get an extra die or two on your dice roll, and you keep the highest two.  Things that make something harder, like trying to use two weapons at once without training, gives you Obstacles: an extra die or two on your dice roll, but you keep the two &lt;em&gt;lowest&lt;/em&gt; rolls.  Edges cancel out Obstacles and vice versa.  Combat is theater of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demoicity&lt;/em&gt;’s version of &lt;em&gt;BESM&lt;/em&gt;’s Attributes are quite stripped down.  There are only nine: Adaptability, Damage, Demonicity, Fighting, Knacks, Movement, Resistance, Resources, and Skills.  These are bought in levels as usual, but associated with each are a number of Foci (as many as one has levels in the Attribute), which gives the character a special ability.  Demonicity is the Attribute that allows a character to do most of the more impressive supernatural things, for instance.  A few of its Foci are Healing, Meld (mere with inanimate objects), and Shadow Form.  The Fighting Attribute makes a character more proficient at combat than their Stats would suggest, and it’s Foci specify which kinds of Fighting you are better at (Melee or Ranged), or makes it easier to do certain things in combat (Blind Fighting, Two Weapons).  Generally, an Attribute’s level adds to dice rolls for things associated with it, while having an appropriate Foci means that you get an Edge.  After every session characters get a few points to increase their Stats and Attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rulebook is only 32 pages long and has a thicker card stock cover.  It is accompanied by six one page adventures with related art on the back and by six pre-generated characters with an image of the character on the back, all on card stock.  There are also four six-sided dice.  The box everything comes in seems sturdy.  In general the production values are quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are confident with their improvisation skills can probably run the adventures easily, but those who like more details will probably want to do a bit more preparation. The adventures appear designed to be easily linked into a six episode mini-campaign, or can form the backbone of a longer campaign if the GM writes their own adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the inclusion of the pre-generated characters and the one page adventures.  They allow a gaming group to pick the game and start playing with little or no preparation.  And the simplified rules make it easy to learn the game, and to create characters if the gaming group doesn't want to use the pre-generated characters.  I think this makes it an excellent pick-up-and-play game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to have seen something like the adventure generators from various Savage Worlds setting books or Toon and its supplements.  They allow the GM who is stuck for ideas to come up with something quickly when inspiration is lacking. But it would have been difficult to fit in the constraints of the product.  Perhaps on another sheet of card stock, since I can’t see deleting anything from the rulebook?  BESM and Tri-Stat generally have very little procedural support for coming up with NPCs, scenes, adventures, etc., and I think an adventure generator would be a useful addition. Of course, having the example adventures to give an idea of what &lt;em&gt;Demonicity&lt;/em&gt; adventures would be like is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I quite like &lt;em&gt;Demonicity&lt;/em&gt; and hope to play it soon.  My only reservations are about the price of this game and the other two Tri-Stat boxed games, &lt;em&gt;Pixies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wyrms&lt;/em&gt;.  Forty-five retail dollars Canadian for the &lt;a href="http://dyskami.ca/tristat.html"&gt;physical product&lt;/a&gt; seems like a lot.  The &lt;a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369442/Demonicity-RolePlaying-Adventures-TriStat-System"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; seems more reasonable at 15 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>demonicity</category><category>dyskami</category><category>rpg</category><category>tri-stat</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/12/02/demonicity-a-tri-stat-boxed-game-by-dyskami/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 03:54:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy Role-Playing Adventures</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/06/14/anime-5e-fifth-edition-fantasy-role-playing-adventures/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you like D&amp;amp;D 5E, but would like to have it with with point-based
character generation, effects-based rules, and an Anime
flavour?  Well &lt;em&gt;Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy
Role-Playing Adventures&lt;/em&gt; is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My physical copies of &lt;em&gt;Anime 5E: Fifth Edition Fantasy Role-Playing
Adventures&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dyskami.ca/anime5e.html"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dyskami/anime-5e-fifth-edition-fantasy-role-playing-reimagined"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359098/Anime-5E-Fifth-Edition-Fantasy-RolePlaying-Adventures"&gt;DriveThruRPG page&lt;/a&gt;)
from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dyskami.ca/index.html"&gt;Dyskami Publishing Company&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_C._MacKinnon"&gt;Mark C. MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt; came
today, and I have only had a chance to briefly skim the pocket
edition, but I'm pleased at what they managed to fit into the small
package of 384 pages and a physical size of approximately 12.5cm wide
× 18.9cm tall × 2.25cm thick (4 15/16in wide × 7 13/32in tall ×
27/32in thick) and still have the text be large enough to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of the Pocket Edition, with another picture with my
hand covering the book for size comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/Anime-5E-pocket-edition.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anime 5E pocket edition" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/Anime-5E-pocket-edition.thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/Anime-5E-pocket-edition-size-comparison.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anime 5E pocket edition with hand for size comparison" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/Anime-5E-pocket-edition-size-comparison.thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that adding the flexibility of Dynamic Powers attribute
as magic (p. 154) is very interesting I would like to have seen a
little guidance for using the rest of the attributes as spells using
the Deplete limiter (p. 237) and the optional Energy rules (p. 280);
I've seen the similar rules in BESM (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth"&gt;BESM1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dyskami.ca/besm.html"&gt;BESM2&lt;/a&gt;) used very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have to wait until I get a chance to peruse the hardback version
to comment on the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later: I just have to add: &lt;strong&gt;OMG! Battle Cabbits!&lt;/strong&gt; (On p. 367.) So
cute!  Now, if they only turned into spaceships as well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked the Items chapter, especially the “Ring of Power”.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my work making an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/05/31/mini-six-question-why-are-perditions-pilot-and-mechanic-identical/'https:/github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6'"&gt;SRD for Mini
Six&lt;/a&gt; I was reminded
that in the Perdition sample setting the character templates for the
Pilot and the Mechanic are identical, which seems odd. Here, take a
look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mini Six’s Pilot and Mechanic, from the Perdition sample setting" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/mini-six-perdition-pilot-and-mechanic.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini Six’s Pilot and Mechanic, from the Perdition sample setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a version of the original Mechanic in text format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Might 2D+1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility 3D+2&lt;/strong&gt; — Dodge 5D+1, Pilot 5D+2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wit 3D+1&lt;/strong&gt; — Computer 4D, Navigation 5D+1, Repair 4D+1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charm 2D+2&lt;/strong&gt; — Diplomacy 4D&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static:&lt;/strong&gt; Dodge 16, Block 7, Parry 7, Soak 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perks &amp;amp; Comps:&lt;/strong&gt; None&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear:&lt;/strong&gt; Light Pistol&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought something like this might be better for the Mechanic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Mechanic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Might 2D+1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility 3D+1&lt;/strong&gt; — Dodge 5D, Pilot 4D&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wit 3D+2&lt;/strong&gt; — Computer 6D, Navigation 4D+1, Repair 6D+1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charm 2D+2&lt;/strong&gt; — Diplomacy 3D&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perks &amp;amp; Comps:&lt;/strong&gt; None&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear:&lt;/strong&gt; Light Pistol&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static:&lt;/strong&gt; Dodge 15; Block 7; Parry 7; Soak 7&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still has some skill at Pilot and Navigation, but not as good at those
as the Pilot. Better Computer and Repair skills. Probably willing to
pick up a pistol and shoot it if really necessary, but also probably no
better at it that default, so Pistol isn’t listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Pilot and the Mechanic templates are built on 12D
in attributes and 8D+2 in skills, instead of the standard 7D in
skills, so I made this alternate version with the same amount. I
haven’t checked the other templates. (I’ll probably do that at some
point. Rather than do the counting manually, I’ll probably type them
up as YAML and feed them through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkurtbond/m6charcost/blob/main/sm6.scm"&gt;sm6&lt;/a&gt;, a program I wrote that counts
the costs of all the dice and prints out a summary. I’ve got a couple
other programs, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkurtbond/m6charcost/blob/main/sm6rst.scm"&gt;sm6rst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkurtbond/m6charcost/blob/main/sm6troff-ms.scm"&gt;sm6troff-ms&lt;/a&gt; that can read that same
YAML and produce output in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt; or troff (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://troff.org/"&gt;T1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/"&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt;)
formats, for including in my documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also posted this question at a few online forums: the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenD6/comments/v1v572/mini_six_question_why_are_perditions_pilot_and/"&gt;/r/OpenD6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/v1va29/mini_six_question_why_are_perditions_pilot_and/"&gt;/r/rpg&lt;/a&gt; subreddits, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpgpub.com/threads/mini-six-question-why-are-perditions-pilot-and-mechanic-identical.7600/"&gt;RPG Pub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/mini-six-question-why-are-perditions-pilot-and-mechanic-identical.897842/"&gt;rpg.net&lt;/a&gt;,
which I'm listing here so I can be reminded of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>d6</category><category>mini six</category><category>opend6</category><category>perdition</category><category>rpg</category><category>rpg utilities</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/05/31/mini-six-question-why-are-perditions-pilot-and-mechanic-identical/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 18:41:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Announcing Minimal OpenD6, an SRD for Mini Six</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/05/30/announcing-minimal-opend6-an-srd-for-mini-six/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Anybody interested in an SRD for &lt;em&gt;Mini Six&lt;/em&gt;? Since &lt;em&gt;Mini Six&lt;/em&gt; is under
the Open Game License, I have created one for it, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6"&gt;Minimal
OpenD6&lt;/a&gt;. (It does
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include the Product Identity portions, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want to read the rules I still think the original &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144558/Mini-Six-Bare-Bones-Edition"&gt;Mini Six:
Bare Bones
Edition&lt;/a&gt;
is a great document, packing so much into a dense but readable layout,
so download it for free or get a print copy. However, if you want a
custom version of the rules, whether you are producing a completely new
game or just want a version of the rules with all your house rules
incorporated, this should be a great starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why start with &lt;em&gt;Minimal OpenD6&lt;/em&gt; instead of of &lt;em&gt;OpenD6&lt;/em&gt;? Because you want
to start with a minimal core and add things gradually, rather than
starting with a very large document and cutting out everything you don’t
want! (Different approaches work better for different folks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimal OpenD6&lt;/em&gt; provides
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt; source
for the document, as well as simple PDF, HTML, EPUB, Microsoft Word
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt;, OpenOffice/LibreOffice &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.odt&lt;/code&gt;, and Markdown output.
Conversions to other formats are possible using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; or other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want the output files without any of the stuff used to build
them, look at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tkurtbond/Minimal-OpenD6/releases"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; page
in the repository for a zip file.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mini six</category><category>minimal opend6</category><category>opend6</category><category>rpg</category><category>srd</category><category>system reference document</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2022/05/30/announcing-minimal-opend6-an-srd-for-mini-six/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 15:49:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Isle of the Plangent Mage</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/12/the-isle-of-the-plangent-mage/</link><dc:creator>T.

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4234102437"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an interesting adventure intertwining the sea, its creatures, and music. It describes a small area of coast with a village and inhabitants, a nearby island with several interesting locations, some inhabitants, and a dungeon with a good mix of monsters and interesting devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another very good adventure from Necrotic Gnome.

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading the &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome&lt;/cite&gt; from cover to cover and I am very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say in my terse Goodreads review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576056628l/49203328._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy"&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16187767.Gavin_Norman"&gt;Gavin Norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D (B/X D&amp;amp;D) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games/#how-i-got-started"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; that I started playing with first edition AD&amp;amp;D.
As far as I can remember, we often simplified things: I don't remember
using segments, spell components, weapon speed factors, or armor class
adjustments, and I'm not sure we used anything like the actual
official combat sequence.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#addict" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I never picked up the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert Sets, unfortunately, since I foolishly
thought “Advanced” meant better than “Basic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; is an wonderful way
for someone to learn the rules of classic D&amp;amp;D, and for running classic
D&amp;amp;D campaigns.  I wish it had been around when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.
I'd recommend it today for anyone learning to play, or anyone who
prefers the classic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- See DMG p. 61, “Encounters, Combat, and Initiative”. --&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote-list brackets"&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="addict" role="note"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#footnote-reference-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules on Initiative on p. 62–63 of the Dungeon Master's Guide
(DMG) sound simple, but there are further elaborations elsewhere in
the DMG (“Simultaneous Initiative” on p. 66, for instance) and
other AD&amp;amp;D 1E rule books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a 20 page document, &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons®
Initiative and Combat Table&lt;/cite&gt;, compiled by David M. Prata, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://idiscepolidellamanticora.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/addict.pdf"&gt;I1&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://knights-n-knaves.com/dmprata/ADDICT.pdf"&gt;I2&lt;/a&gt;) to come anywhere near compiling and explaining the actual
first edition AD&amp;amp;D initiative and combat sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely convinced that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a completely
consistent interpretation of the rules, but people have spent a lot
of time and effort trying to figure one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's a brief but clear discussion of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Initiative
Controversy&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706181418/http://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; on archive.org) describing both The
A.D.D.I.C.T. Method and the OSRIC method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&amp;amp;D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; would probably be my first
choice for any new D&amp;amp;D campaign I start, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
