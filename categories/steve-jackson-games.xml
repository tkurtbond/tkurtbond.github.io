Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, one of the things L.B. really wanted to do this winter vacation
was play &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sjgames.com/toon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, since I'd been so bad
about getting things prepared and even worse getting things scheduled,
we almost didn't get to play.  We did get to play a short &lt;em&gt;Toon&lt;/em&gt;
session, though, while visiting C.P.B., my older brother, and his
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roster was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.B., I think playing a chocolate loving bear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.P.B. and M.B., playing an elf named Ralph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.B., playing a hovering suit of plate armor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toon&lt;/em&gt;, as an inherently comic game, is hard for me to prepare and run.
Luckily, it has a very useful “Adventure Generator”, and I had used it
earlier to get some general ideas, and I wrote a few paragraphs in my
notebook about them and picked and adapted some characters from the many
NPCs in the &lt;em&gt;Toon&lt;/em&gt; rulebook.  When we finally got around to playing we
didn't have time to create new PCs, so I just passed out some old
character sheets, and they all picked toons they'd created in earlier
sessions, and away we went.  I pretty much improvised on the stuff
from my notebooks, and the kids seemed to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>actual-play</category><category>kids</category><category>rpg</category><category>steve jackson games</category><category>toon</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/01/02/toon-the-tomb-of-throckmorton-p-ruddygore/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2009 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
