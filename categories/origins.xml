&lt;p&gt;I asked if Hite was familiar enough with Steampunk to say what the
story is in that (to me) obscure genre.  He pointed out that it’s
now more an aesthetic than a genre, the goggles and leather and
glass and so forth (and corsets for women?).  Yet he then made an
erudite comparison, saying that just as fairy stories helped
Victorians reconcile with what was a pretty ugly past (and where
the real fairy stories were “don’t go out on the moor at night or
they’ll eat you”), steampunk helps people reconcile with
technology.  Modern technology is a “black box” to most people,
but most people can understand that hot steam expands and can move
things, and feel comfortable with the steam engines and
“clockwork” of Steampunk.  Steampunk helps people come to terms
with technology.  A remarkable answer.&lt;/p&gt;
