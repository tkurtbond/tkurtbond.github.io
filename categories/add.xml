Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran across an interesting article: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107143330/http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com:80/2012/02/d-next-zones-of-control-from-chainmail.html"&gt;D&amp;amp;D Next: "Zones of Control"
from Chainmail to 4e&lt;/a&gt; which argues, I think with good evidence, that
every version of &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has been based in miniatures as its default
mode of play.  (Alas the original site of this article, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com"&gt;Advanced
Dungeons &amp;amp; Parenting&lt;/a&gt; appears to having fallen to some annoying
entropy creating demons.  Some poking about seems to show the original
author being Christian Lindke of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.geekeratimedia.com/"&gt;Geekerati&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split between abstract combat and miniatures combat was well
established by the time I started with &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, reading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1977_version"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/every-edition-of-dd-has-specified-some-things-in-terms-of-miniatures/#holmes" id="id4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; edition and then playing first edition &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;.  We never
played with miniatures.  Indeed, I think the hex grid and miniatures
based tactical combat rules were one of the things that drew me to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm irritated that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast"&gt;Wizards of the Coast&lt;/a&gt; has not yet
added the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1977_version"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt; edition, the 1977 blue box Basic Set,
to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dmsguild.com/"&gt;DM's Guild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/turning-dd-character-deaths-into-deal-that-benefits-game-and-story/"&gt;Turning Character Deaths in D&amp;amp;D Into Deals that
Benefit Game and Story&lt;/a&gt;, David Hartlage (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/"&gt;DM David&lt;/a&gt;) points out an
interesting quote from Gary Gygax in the &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; on Character Death.  (The
whole post is worth reading, as are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/start-here-my-most-popular-and-favorite-posts/"&gt;many of his others&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went looking for the quote so I could give a more complete reference
for it.  (PDF versions of old gaming books are wonderful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first edition &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master%27s_Guide#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;Dungeon Master's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, on p. 110, in the
section “Conducting the Game”, subsection “Rolling the Dice and
Control of the Game”, Gary Gygax wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then a player will die through no fault of his own. He or
she will have done everything correctly, taken every reasonable
precaution, but still the freakish roll of the dice will kill the
character. In the long run you should let such things pass as the
players will kill more than one opponent with their own freakish
rolls at some later time. Yet you do have the right to arbitrate
the situation. You can rule that the player, instead of dying, is
knocked unconscious, loses a limb, is blinded in one eye or invoke
any reasonably severe penalty that still takes into account what
the monster has done. It is very demoralizing to the players to
lose a cared-for-player character when they have played well. When
they have done something stupid or have not taken precautions,
then let the dice fall where they may!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, every time I read the original &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at
everything that Gygax managed to fit into that book.  Of course, when
I read the three booklets of original &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at what he
managed to fit in those as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>1e</category><category>ad&amp;d</category><category>d&amp;d</category><category>gygax</category><category>od&amp;d</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/gygax-on-character-death/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 18:27:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>System Complexity and Gamer Preferences</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2012/03/15/system-complexity-and-gamer-preferences/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504101948/http://www.koboldquarterly.com/k/front-page11985.php"&gt;Howling Tower: Complexity and Option Fatigue « Kobold
Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.howlingtower.com/"&gt;Steve Winter&lt;/a&gt; (ex-TSR, ex-WotC):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, TSR studied the sales appeal of AD&amp;amp;D compared to
“Basic” D&amp;amp;D (Basic/Expert, B/X, or BECMI, as it’s now known). The
common wisdom was that Basic D&amp;amp;D was the best choice for beginning
players because it was a simpler game—it had fewer rules. New and
inexperienced players, however, actually saw that paucity of rules as
a drawback. To them, Basic D&amp;amp;D was more complex than Advanced D&amp;amp;D, not
less, because the DM and players were faced with more situations that
had no clear solution. In contrast, AD&amp;amp;D told you exactly (or
approximately) what to do in an enormous range of situations. The
answers might be hard to find, but they were in those books
somewhere. Extensive rules that covered more situations translated to
the DM spending more time flipping pages in a search for answers but
less time sifting through options. The end result was a perception
that while AD&amp;amp;D had more rules than Basic D&amp;amp;D, all those rules made it
easier to play. Inexperienced players liked the confidence that came
from AD&amp;amp;D providing all the answers, so they gravitated toward
AD&amp;amp;D. Experienced players liked having open-ended options and were the
main audience for Basic D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result surprised a lot of people inside TSR. It was an
eye-opener, and it affected design and marketing philosophy for years.&lt;/p&gt;
