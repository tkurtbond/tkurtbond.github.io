My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4234102437"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an interesting adventure intertwining the sea, its creatures, and music. It describes a small area of coast with a village and inhabitants, a nearby island with several interesting locations, some inhabitants, and a dungeon with a good mix of monsters and interesting devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another very good adventure from Necrotic Gnome.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[I actually finished reading this back on July 9, 2021, but forgot to
finish this post, so it is appearing now.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading the &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome&lt;/cite&gt; from cover to cover and I am very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say in my terse Goodreads review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576056628l/49203328._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy"&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16187767.Gavin_Norman"&gt;Gavin Norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D (B/X D&amp;amp;D) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13454227-t-kurt"&gt;View all my reviews on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games/#how-i-got-started"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; that I started playing with first edition AD&amp;amp;D.
As far as I can remember, we often simplified things: I don't remember
using segments, spell components, weapon speed factors, or armor class
adjustments, and I'm not sure we used anything like the actual
official combat sequence.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#addict" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I never picked up the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert Sets, unfortunately, since I foolishly
thought “Advanced” meant better than “Basic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; is an wonderful way
for someone to learn the rules of classic D&amp;amp;D, and for running classic
D&amp;amp;D campaigns.  I wish it had been around when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.
I'd recommend it today for anyone learning to play, or anyone who
prefers the classic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- See DMG p. 61, “Encounters, Combat, and Initiative”. --&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="addict"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules on Initiative on p. 62–63 of the Dungeon Master's Guide
(DMG) sound simple, but there are further elaborations elsewhere in
the DMG (“Simultaneous Initiative” on p. 66, for instance) and
other AD&amp;amp;D 1E rule books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a 20 page document, &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons®
Initiative and Combat Table&lt;/cite&gt;, compiled by David M. Prata, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://idiscepolidellamanticora.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/addict.pdf"&gt;I1&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://knights-n-knaves.com/dmprata/ADDICT.pdf"&gt;I2&lt;/a&gt;) to come anywhere near compiling and explaining the actual
first edition AD&amp;amp;D initiative and combat sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely convinced that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a completely
consistent interpretation of the rules, but people have spent a lot
of time and effort trying to figure one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's a brief but clear discussion of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Initiative
Controversy&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706181418/http://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; on archive.org) describing both The
A.D.D.I.C.T. Method and the OSRIC method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&amp;amp;D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; would probably be my first
choice for any new D&amp;amp;D campaign I start, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4056920456"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the classes, races, spells, and other player facing rules of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must admit I miss the monk, and the two Hit Dice at first level of the Ranger from AD&amp;amp;D 1E, but I suppose the former is out because of the common perception that it doesn't thematically fit the pseudo-medieval setting of most D&amp;amp;D games, and the latter is part of adapting to the scale of B/X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome is another excellent presentation of the classic rules in a well designed and sturdy hard back book. I'm impressed with the organization and clarity of the presentation. I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic player rules.

Another excellent adventure from Gavin Norman. It even can be hooked up Hole in the Oak, an earlier adventure from him. It uses the same design as Hole in the Oak, where bolding and bullet points call attention to important points in the order you generally need them. This adventure improves on Hole in the Wall by including the relevant portion of the map on each two page spread describing the locations. Very well done.

If you are looking for a way to customize existing classes or create new classes for B/X D&amp;amp;D style games, especially Old-School Essentials, this book is a wonderful resource. It breaks the original classes down into their fundamental parts and provides a simple system for building those parts into new or customized classes. It presents the breakdown for each of the original classes, then provides a list of class variants, customized versions of the original class, as well as sub-classes, heavily redesigned classes. For instance, for the Cleric, the class variants are: Cleric (Dead God), Cleric (God of Death), Cleric (God of Knowledge), Cleric (God of Life), Cleric (God of Nature), and Cleric (God of War); and the sub-classes are Crusader and Shaman. Class variants and sub-classes are presented for Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfling, Magic-User, and Thief. It also provides a version of Thief skills using the d6, other d6 skills that can be used in creating classes, some additional armour, weapons, and ammunition, an optional table for spell failure in appropriate circumstances (for example, when non-casters read a spell scroll), a table of special abilities gained by classes that have animal companions, differing depending on the animal in question, and options for characters to gain at high levels, beyond the limits of their level progression tables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll definitely be using this in my next B/X-style game!

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One simple improvement on B/X D&amp;amp;D and OD&amp;amp;D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I've wished
that the B/X and OD&amp;amp;D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions, like that of AD&amp;amp;D.  As it
is, you have to read the spell description to figure out if a saving
throw is allowed and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Basic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Core&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Whitebox&lt;/cite&gt;; and &lt;cite&gt;Delving
Deeper&lt;/cite&gt;, all fail to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; surprised that &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I started playing with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E (in 1979 or 1980) we didn't use
miniatures or battle maps, it was all theater of the mind.  Since all
the players I knew personally started with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; none of us had seen
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"&gt;Chainmail&lt;/a&gt; or played miniatures games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved on to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd edition, (in the mid 1980s) where
a hex grid and miniatures was required, I bought a Chessex hex grid
Megamat and wet erase markers.  One of my brothers had bought a box of
miniatures (though for the life of me I cannot remember what company
it was from or what figures it contained).  We used those for player
characters.  For monsters, I cut out a bunch of ¾ inch square blocks
of wood and numbered them on the top side, put a “D” for Dead on the
bottom side, put an “S” on another smooth side for Stunned, and a “U”
for Unconscious, leaving the rough sides (where the wood was cut
against the grain) blank.  I continued to use all these when I moved
over to using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 3rd edition, which also had specific Stunned and
and Unconscious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later I got the Steve Jackson Games Cardboard Heroes but
never could bear to cut them up, since I wasn't actively playing at
the time it came out (1999 or so?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; again with 3.5E (probably sometime
after 2004) I mostly played and didn't DM.  I was fortunate that the
DMs that I played with had good collections of pre-painted plastic
miniatures for both player characters and monsters from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Miniatures_Game"&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&lt;/a&gt;.  I did collect some of the Dungeon Tiles
(see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Tiles"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/a-complete-list-and-gallery-of-dungeon-tiles-sets/"&gt;dmdavid&lt;/a&gt;) that Wizards of the Coast published
during this time. (I actually used them playing Savage Worlds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one campaign that I DMed with 3.5E I bought an Flip Chart/Easel
Pad printed with a 1 inch grid.  I would take several sheets to the
game in a tubular storage container and draw the rooms on the map with
black marker as the players explored.  If we ran off the the side of a
sheet or went to a new level I'd get out another sheet and draw on
that.  This worked surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One GM had a fair bit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dwarvenforge.com/"&gt;Dwarven Forge&lt;/a&gt; terrain and that was a lot
of fun to play on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (around 2005) I did a lot of
GMing, and was thrilled by the Figure Flats and map tiles that that
Great White Games (now known again as Pinnacle Entertainment Group —
PEG) included in many of their Savage Tales PDF adventures.  I had a
printer that could print on card stock, so these were ideal for
me.  Later PEG products, such as their Plot Point campaigns, often had
Figure Flats as separate PDF accessories.  I found them all very
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/51074/eAdventure-Tiles-Introductory-Set"&gt;e-Adventure Tiles&lt;/a&gt; series from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/80/SkeletonKey-Games"&gt;SkeletonKey Games&lt;/a&gt;
very useful.  These &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Geomorphic_Map_Tiles"&gt;geomorphic map tiles&lt;/a&gt; are 6×6 inch squares, marked
with a 1 inch square grid, and by printing them out and putting them
together you can produce an infinite variety of maps.  I found them
most useful when printed on cardstock and labeled on the back with
their id number.  I'd make up several maps and then sort out the
printed tiles for that map into a manila envelope for easy
retrieval. There used to be a program that you could use the small
preview images from the tiles (which were considerately set up for
easy Copy and Paste from the PDF) to lay out your map at the small
scale and then print it for reference when later putting together the
large tiles. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#tiamat" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I'd include those in the manila envelope with
the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/667/Arion-Games"&gt;Arion Games&lt;/a&gt; and Disposable Heroes
paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27"&gt;Precis Intermedia&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147348073/Paper-Wars---Dragon-Pass-at-War"&gt;Paper Wars -
Dragon Pass at War&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Glorantha paper miniatures
published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgpublisher/10024/unspoken-word"&gt;The Unspoken Word&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to have been drawn by
Simon Bray, Dario Corallo, and Sarah Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the early paper miniatures that I used were tri-fold and were
cut out, folded, and glued (or taped) together.  They usually had
front sides in color and a back side in black and white.
Unfortunately, these take up almost as much room as lead or plastic
miniatures, though were much lighter to carry.  I stored them in cheap
plastic food containers, which let me easily see what was inside them.
Carrying enough of them to games outside my home was a bulky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved to A-frame paper miniatures, where there are two
sides and they are attached at the top, with tabs that fold out or in
at the bottom for a base.  Instead of relying on the tabs to form the
base, I used plastic &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27_96"&gt;stands&lt;/a&gt; from Precis Intermedia, where you'd just
fold the miniature once and stick it in the stand.  The stands add a bit
of weight to the miniatures and make them much more stable.  If you
cut out a front that is attached to a back, instead of all three
sides, you can just fold them once and stick them in a stand as well,
so I could use all my trifold paper miniatures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zenseeker.net/PaperMiniatures/DIY.htm"&gt;Zen DIY Paper Miniatures Page&lt;/a&gt; has some pictures of A-frame and
trifold paper miniatures.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these paper miniatures are flat when not inserted into stands I
currently organize my paper miniatures into separate small manila
envelopes for each type of creature, labeled with the creature type on
the outside.  Occasionally I use small ziplock bags, especially for
the PCs' miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper miniatures described above are all drawn in such a way that
the figure is drawn within a rectangle and you can cut them out with
long straight cuts and cross cuts.  There is another style of paper
miniatures drawn in a manner so that you cut out the irregular outline
of the figure itself with many small or curving cuts.  These are much
harder to cut out, and are more difficult to store, but are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
impressive to look at.  (You can see some examples in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/monsters.html"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;
collection at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/"&gt;One Monk Miniatures&lt;/a&gt;) That's too much work for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a Steel Sqwire Flip Mat, which uses dry erase pens, and it
is 24×30 inches and folds up into an 8×10 inch package only a ¼ inch
thick or so.  Much easier to carry around, since it fits into the same
backpack or messenger bag I use to carry my RPG books and
accessories. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#accessories" id="id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; More over, unlike the ones you can find
now published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8oto?GameMastery-FlipMat-Basic"&gt;Paizo&lt;/a&gt;, it had both 1 inch squares and 1 inch hexes,
perfect for DragonQuest, GURPS, or The Fantasy Trip, though I've used
mostly the squared side, for Savage Worlds.  The dry erase pens are
much more satisfactory than the wet erase pens.  For some time I
haven't had extra time to lay out locations using paper map tiles, and
the Flip Mat lets me quickly draw out locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually use miniatures and a battle map for Savage Worlds
there have been several occasions where I've run games in theater of
the mind style, without any miniatures or battle map.  It takes a
little adapting, but isn't that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current practice is to use paper miniatures in stands for player
characters and numbered blocks for opponents, with a Flip Mat as the
battle map.  Some times for opponents that take up more than one
square I'll fold over or cut up a 3×5 or 4×6 card and use that,
writing an arrow to indicate which way is the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/melee/"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/wizard/"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; style counters, which lie flat on
the table, but I got in on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-legacy-edition/"&gt;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/the-fantasy-trip-old-school-roleplaying"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and am intending to try them out sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when running &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision"&gt;B/X D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; there of
(like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goblinoidgames.com/"&gt;Goblinoid Games&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord"&gt;L1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/760/Goblinoid-Games/subcategory/2033_6311/Labyrinth-Lord"&gt;L2&lt;/a&gt;), it's &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
inspired &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/a&gt;, or the book that squashes them
together: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259983/Advanced-Labyrinth-Lord-Dragon-Cover?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt;, or like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/"&gt;Necrotic Gnome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials"&gt;Old
School Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/"&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;) it's often theater of the
mind: no miniatures, no battle map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tiamat"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program that I used was a desktop application rather
than a web-based application, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgobjects.com/index.php?c=tiamat"&gt;Tiamat the Tile Mapper&lt;/a&gt; is a
similar application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="accessories"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice of course; usually I carry a couple of extra
sets for when someone forgets their dice.  For Savage Worlds I
carry several differently colored sets of glass beads (stored in
small ziplock bags). I use blue beads for bennies, white beads for
GM bennies, red beads for wounds, yellow beads for shaken and white
beads again for fatigue.  I've found it helps the players (and
myself) to remember their status if they have physical objects
sitting on their character sheet to remind them.  When playing with
numbered blocks for opponents I put the shaken bead on top of the
block; this really helps when I've got 30 opponents on the table.
I carry a couple of decks of playing cards for Savage Worlds
initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
