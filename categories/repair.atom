    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, last night I flopped a book down on my computer.  I didn't notice
it at the time, but it popped off the “N” key.  Luckily, when I opened
it this morning all four pieces were still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Top means toward the display, bottom means toward the
touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pieces, for
lack of better nomenclature, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key surface (the part your finger presses on)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inside part&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The middle part, with small horizontal posts on the outside left
and right edges part way back from the top D. The outside part,
with small horizontal posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to figure out how this pieces fit together and what parts
catch where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a lot of fiddling, but eventually I figured out that it if
I put the outside part on top of the middle part, flattened them, set
them in the space where the key goes, and gently slide them toward the
bottom that the bar at the top of the middle part and posts on the
outside left and right edges of the outside part would slide under the
cuts in the thin metal pieces that stood up from the base of the
keyboard.  Then I hooked the bottom of the inside part under the bar
on the bottom of the middle part and gently pressed down on the front
of the inside piece until it clipped on to the bar of the on the front
of the middle piece.  Once this was done, I had, viewed from the side,
an X with a bar across the top.  Then I slide the key surface onto the
X from the bottom, making sure to hook the back of the X under the lip
on the bottom underside of the key.  Then I gently pressed down on the
key surface until the clips on the front of the key surface clipped
onto the front of the X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
