    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started playing with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E (in 1979 or 1980) we didn't use
miniatures or battle maps, it was all theater of the mind.  Since all
the players I knew personally started with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; none of us had seen
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"&gt;Chainmail&lt;/a&gt; or played miniatures games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved on to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd edition, (in the mid 1980s) where
a hex grid and miniatures was required, I bought a Chessex hex grid
Megamat and wet erase markers.  One of my brothers had bought a box of
miniatures (though for the life of me I cannot remember what company
it was from or what figures it contained).  We used those for player
characters.  For monsters, I cut out a bunch of ¾ inch square blocks
of wood and numbered them on the top side, put a “D” for Dead on the
bottom side, put an “S” on another smooth side for Stunned, and a “U”
for Unconscious, leaving the rough sides (where the wood was cut
against the grain) blank.  I continued to use all these when I moved
over to using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 3rd edition, which also had specific Stunned and
and Unconscious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later I got the Steve Jackson Games Cardboard Heroes but
never could bear to cut them up, since I wasn't actively playing at
the time it came out (1999 or so?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; again with 3.5E (probably sometime
after 2004) I mostly played and didn't DM.  I was fortunate that the
DMs that I played with had good collections of pre-painted plastic
miniatures for both player characters and monsters from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Miniatures_Game"&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&lt;/a&gt;.  I did collect some of the Dungeon Tiles
(see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Tiles"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/a-complete-list-and-gallery-of-dungeon-tiles-sets/"&gt;dmdavid&lt;/a&gt;) that Wizards of the Coast published
during this time. (I actually used them playing Savage Worlds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one campaign that I DMed with 3.5E I bought an Flip Chart/Easel
Pad printed with a 1 inch grid.  I would take several sheets to the
game in a tubular storage container and draw the rooms on the map with
black marker as the players explored.  If we ran off the the side of a
sheet or went to a new level I'd get out another sheet and draw on
that.  This worked surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One GM had a fair bit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dwarvenforge.com/"&gt;Dwarven Forge&lt;/a&gt; terrain and that was a lot
of fun to play on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (around 2005) I did a lot of
GMing, and was thrilled by the Figure Flats and map tiles that that
Great White Games (now known again as Pinnacle Entertainment Group —
PEG) included in many of their Savage Tales PDF adventures.  I had a
printer that could print on card stock, so these were ideal for
me.  Later PEG products, such as their Plot Point campaigns, often had
Figure Flats as separate PDF accessories.  I found them all very
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/51074/eAdventure-Tiles-Introductory-Set"&gt;e-Adventure Tiles&lt;/a&gt; series from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/80/SkeletonKey-Games"&gt;SkeletonKey Games&lt;/a&gt;
very useful.  These &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Geomorphic_Map_Tiles"&gt;geomorphic map tiles&lt;/a&gt; are 6×6 inch squares, marked
with a 1 inch square grid, and by printing them out and putting them
together you can produce an infinite variety of maps.  I found them
most useful when printed on cardstock and labeled on the back with
their id number.  I'd make up several maps and then sort out the
printed tiles for that map into a manila envelope for easy
retrieval. There used to be a program that you could use the small
preview images from the tiles (which were considerately set up for
easy Copy and Paste from the PDF) to lay out your map at the small
scale and then print it for reference when later putting together the
large tiles. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#tiamat" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I'd include those in the manila envelope with
the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/667/Arion-Games"&gt;Arion Games&lt;/a&gt; and Disposable Heroes
paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27"&gt;Precis Intermedia&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147348073/Paper-Wars---Dragon-Pass-at-War"&gt;Paper Wars -
Dragon Pass at War&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Glorantha paper miniatures
published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgpublisher/10024/unspoken-word"&gt;The Unspoken Word&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to have been drawn by
Simon Bray, Dario Corallo, and Sarah Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the early paper miniatures that I used were tri-fold and were
cut out, folded, and glued (or taped) together.  They usually had
front sides in color and a back side in black and white.
Unfortunately, these take up almost as much room as lead or plastic
miniatures, though were much lighter to carry.  I stored them in cheap
plastic food containers, which let me easily see what was inside them.
Carrying enough of them to games outside my home was a bulky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved to A-frame paper miniatures, where there are two
sides and they are attached at the top, with tabs that fold out or in
at the bottom for a base.  Instead of relying on the tabs to form the
base, I used plastic &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27_96"&gt;stands&lt;/a&gt; from Precis Intermedia, where you'd just
fold the miniature once and stick it in the stand.  The stands add a bit
of weight to the miniatures and make them much more stable.  If you
cut out a front that is attached to a back, instead of all three
sides, you can just fold them once and stick them in a stand as well,
so I could use all my trifold paper miniatures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zenseeker.net/PaperMiniatures/DIY.htm"&gt;Zen DIY Paper Miniatures Page&lt;/a&gt; has some pictures of A-frame and
trifold paper miniatures.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these paper miniatures are flat when not inserted into stands I
currently organize my paper miniatures into separate small manila
envelopes for each type of creature, labeled with the creature type on
the outside.  Occasionally I use small ziplock bags, especially for
the PCs' miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper miniatures described above are all drawn in such a way that
the figure is drawn within a rectangle and you can cut them out with
long straight cuts and cross cuts.  There is another style of paper
miniatures drawn in a manner so that you cut out the irregular outline
of the figure itself with many small or curving cuts.  These are much
harder to cut out, and are more difficult to store, but are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
impressive to look at.  (You can see some examples in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/monsters.html"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;
collection at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/"&gt;One Monk Miniatures&lt;/a&gt;) That's too much work for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a Steel Sqwire Flip Mat, which uses dry erase pens, and it
is 24×30 inches and folds up into an 8×10 inch package only a ¼ inch
thick or so.  Much easier to carry around, since it fits into the same
backpack or messenger bag I use to carry my RPG books and
accessories. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#accessories" id="id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; More over, unlike the ones you can find
now published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8oto?GameMastery-FlipMat-Basic"&gt;Paizo&lt;/a&gt;, it had both 1 inch squares and 1 inch hexes,
perfect for DragonQuest, GURPS, or The Fantasy Trip, though I've used
mostly the squared side, for Savage Worlds.  The dry erase pens are
much more satisfactory than the wet erase pens.  For some time I
haven't had extra time to lay out locations using paper map tiles, and
the Flip Mat lets me quickly draw out locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually use miniatures and a battle map for Savage Worlds
there have been several occasions where I've run games in theater of
the mind style, without any miniatures or battle map.  It takes a
little adapting, but isn't that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current practice is to use paper miniatures in stands for player
characters and numbered blocks for opponents, with a Flip Mat as the
battle map.  Some times for opponents that take up more than one
square I'll fold over or cut up a 3×5 or 4×6 card and use that,
writing an arrow to indicate which way is the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/melee/"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/wizard/"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; style counters, which lie flat on
the table, but I got in on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-legacy-edition/"&gt;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/the-fantasy-trip-old-school-roleplaying"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and am intending to try them out sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when running &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision"&gt;B/X D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; there of
(like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goblinoidgames.com/"&gt;Goblinoid Games&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord"&gt;L1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/760/Goblinoid-Games/subcategory/2033_6311/Labyrinth-Lord"&gt;L2&lt;/a&gt;), it's &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
inspired &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/a&gt;, or the book that squashes them
together: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259983/Advanced-Labyrinth-Lord-Dragon-Cover?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt;, or like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/"&gt;Necrotic Gnome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials"&gt;Old
School Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/"&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;) it's all theater of the
mind: no miniatures, no battle map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tiamat"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program that I used was a desktop application rather
than a web-based application, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgobjects.com/index.php?c=tiamat"&gt;Tiamat the Tile Mapper&lt;/a&gt; is a
similar application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="accessories"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice of course; usually I carry a couple of extra
sets for when someone forgets their dice.  For Savage Worlds I
carry several differently colored sets of glass beads (stored in
small ziplock bags). I use blue beads for bennies, white beads for
GM bennies, red beads for wounds, yellow beads for shaken and white
beads again for fatigue.  I've found it helps the players (and
myself) to remember their status if they have physical objects
sitting on their character sheet to remind them.  When playing with
numbered blocks for opponents I put the shaken bead on top of the
block; this really helps when I've got 30 opponents on the table.
I carry a couple of decks of playing cards for Savage Worlds
initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

    <title>4E D&amp;D admits what game it's always been?</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been hearing a lot of people saying, in effect, that 4E D&amp;amp;D
admits what kind of game D&amp;amp;D has always been and tunes everything for
that: butt-kicking tactical battle-mat kick-in-the-door, kill
everything, and take it's stuff gamist play. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#whatpodcast" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Right now
I'm ignoring the later bit about what 4E does and how well it does it,
and looking at the earlier bit's claims about “the kind of game D&amp;amp;D
has always been”.  I'm not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, right now, is sort of a placeholder.  I intend to fill in
my history with D&amp;amp;D and look at the various editions of D&amp;amp;D that I've
got and see if they support the “the kind of game D&amp;amp;D has always been”
remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/01/triad-odnd-tekumel-tnt/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; the release of 4E and the choruses of “It's
not real D&amp;amp;D” actually got me interested me in looking back at what
D&amp;amp;D really was, so I bought PDFs of Original D&amp;amp;D (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/"&gt;RPGNow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#wotc-kerfluffle" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) and its supplements and Chainmail and printed
them all out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the
original form factor.  I've read &lt;cite&gt;Chainmail&lt;/cite&gt; and the three pamphlets
that made up the original D&amp;amp;D release (X, Y, Z) completely, and have
scanned the others.  (Oddly enough, I've still not got beyond scanning
4E.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="od-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of D&amp;amp;D, along with some of its supplements, was
still available in some hobby shops when I started playing RPGs, but
the group I played with had was strictly AD&amp;amp;D, so I completely missed
out playing the original, as well as its follow-ons, the various
versions of Basic D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the retrogaming community has commented that the play
experience for this for this version of D&amp;amp;D is very different from all
versions that came after it.  From my initial reading, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="blue-box-holmes-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blue Box/Holmes D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this boxed set for Christmas one year as a young teenager, and
was fascinated.  My box came with B2 — The Keep on the Borderlands.
The group I ended up with, however, played AD&amp;amp;D.  I think I ran this a
couple of times for my younger brother.  My original copy of the
rulebook walked off many years ago, but I picked up the reproduction
cheap a year or so after the anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="moldvay-cook-basic-expert-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moldvay/Cook Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this in stores as a teenager, but never picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a copy of the rulebooks (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nobleknight.com/"&gt;Noble Knight&lt;/a&gt;) at some point,
and can see why so many speak so fondly of it.  It is a clear, well
written presentation of the ideas from OD&amp;amp;D with the unevenness sanded
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="advanced-d-d-1e"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D, 1E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my real introduction to roleplaying games, and continued as
the main game in the groups where I played until college, with
occasional bouts of Tunnels and Trolls.  We played mostly homegrown
campaigns; for some reason the AD&amp;amp;D modules didn't work as well for
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="red-box-mentzer-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Box/Mentzer D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got a chance to play Red Box, but I got the PDFs from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/"&gt;RPGNow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="rules-cyclopedia-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules Cyclopedia D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a lot of folks extolling the virtues of the one-book RC D&amp;amp;D,
so I searched around a found a reasonably priced copy.  Well worth the
money.  This is without a doubt the most complete-in-one-book version
of D&amp;amp;D, at least until the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="advanced-d-d-2e"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D, 2E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When 2E came out I'd long since moved on from D&amp;amp;D, and had been
playing &lt;em&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GURPS&lt;/em&gt; for long while.  I played 2E very
briefly, just before 3E came out, with a guy who'd been on a 3E
playtest and hated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="e-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3E D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely missed playing this at the time, but have played a few
sessions during the 3.5E era with folks who played 3E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.5E D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played this a fair bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="whatpodcast"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;What podcast did I hear this on?  Voice of the
Revolution, said by Paul Tevis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is unfinished, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="part-i-origins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part I: Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I owned was the Holmes blue-box edition of &lt;cite&gt;Basic
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;; the first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I played was &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E.  I was in junior
high when I got the Holmes box set for Christmas from my parents.  (If
I am remembering correctly.)  That summer I started playing &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
with a group of my brother's friends from high school, and I played
with them until that group gradually dispersed, some when they left
the state for college, and some when they left the state after college
for jobs elsewhere.  I had long been DMing by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldritch_Wizardry"&gt;Eldritch Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; in the local
hobby store when I first started playing, but I never saw the original
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I ever looked at the later Moldvay/Cook or Mentzer
&lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; lines, other than buying &lt;cite&gt;Isle of Dread&lt;/cite&gt;, thinking like
many that if I was already playing &lt;cite&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; that &lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
wouldn't have much to offer. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#basic-dnd" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My younger brother joined the group at some point.  He got &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp;
Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; as a Christmas present one year, from my uncle Chuckie, if I
remember correctly.  We played it several times, but it was a simpler
game than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and at the time seemed to offer less, though in an
entertaining way. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#tnt" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, 1st edition, was probably the first RPG I bought, other
than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.  (How did we buy the &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; books?) We never played
&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, for some reason.  Probably because I wasn't able to
figure out the rules, or because it was too gonzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still in junior high, or perhaps my first year in high school, I
ran across &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.  Although it was written in a “numbered
rules” style that I was unfamiliar with (having never played wargames)
that required me to read it closely several times through before I
understood any of it, I was fascinated by it from the very first read.
&lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;'s skills gave all characters interesting distinguishing
abilities, where as in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; only thieves had similar such abilities
(other classes depending on selection of spells to distinguish the
magic using classes and magic items to distinguish the others.)  The
D100 based unified mechanic used by &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; was also very attractive, as
was the more detailed combat system.  The professional skills seemed
less restrictive and therefore less of a mere game construct than the
equivalent &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; classes.  The fact that every character could learn
magic also seemed freeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the only &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure that I was able to find at the
time was Paul Jaquays' &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; was also a plus, because I
found it to be head and shoulders above any other adventure I had seen
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can seen now that  most of these things I liked about &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; were the
things that added to greater detail in distinguishing characters, as
well as what I called realism them, but today might more accurately
call verisimilitude.  I think a good part of it was that by this time
&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; had become its own genre and I wanted something less tied to
those particular tropes.  &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; seemed to simulate a wider variety of
fantasy than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to say that I was suffering from an anti-D&amp;amp;D
backlash at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I bought a copy of Avalon Hill's &lt;cite&gt;Powers &amp;amp; Perils&lt;/cite&gt;.  (If
my memory of buying this from the hobby store in downtown Clarksburg
is correct, I must have bought this fairly early on in my gaming
career.)  At some other point I bought Iron Crown's &lt;cite&gt;Rolemaster&lt;/cite&gt;.
Both of these blew my mind with complexity.  &lt;cite&gt;P&amp;amp;P&lt;/cite&gt;'s setting, however,
was another glimpse at a non-&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; fantasy universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine bought &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; early in our gaming careers.  We
tried making characters a couple of times, but were never able to
figure out what we should do with them afterwards — I think we could
never bridge the gap between dungeon crawling and monsters killing
characters in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and 40– and 50– year old ex military characters
in Traveller.  I don't think we had any &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; adventures to
help us along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a very successful &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; campaign in my first year at
college with three of the original group and a couple of other
players, using Paul Jaquays' wonderful &lt;cite&gt;Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; adventure
setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in college I started a long-running campaign set in SPI's
minimal &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt; setting using &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; at the
beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My leaning to greater detail and verisimilitude lead me in time to
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, with a small detour along the way for 3rd edition
&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Where did I buy RQ? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, 3rd edition (&lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, the Deluxe Boxed Set) and
&lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt; (also a boxed set) in stores, somewhere.  (I think
this must have been near the time they were released.)  Like
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, I found them fascinating.  Unlike &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; I never got my
group to successfully play &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt;.  The players found &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; character
generation to be too complicated, alas.  &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;
were a glimpse into a style of culture-based gaming that I had never
encountered in my &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; experience, but were complicated enough that
my players hated character generation, and we never got much beyond
that.  I never saw &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the Glorantha materials until much, much
later, post Internet.  &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;, though, even with the
occasional incoherence in its Glorantha-less state, resonated with
more depth than anything I had yet seen.  (I never realized, until
years later, that the Paul Jaquays whose &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted
Wood&lt;/cite&gt; had so opened my eyes was also one of the authors of &lt;cite&gt;Griffin
Island&lt;/cite&gt;!  I guess at the time I didn't pay much attention to the
authors/designers of games.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; for me was about even more finely grained definition of
characters.  Learning from problems my players had with &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;
character generation, I created &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; versions of all their
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; characters.  Since, in the process of simulating all
their &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; abilities with &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, I'd along the way upgraded their
characters somewhat in power, everybody had fun and it all worked out.
Already accustomed to a hex-based tactical combat system and
role-under skills from &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;, it was an easy adjustment to &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, and
the campaign continued successfully for many more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, however, that later I moved away from &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; because
making/updating characters was such a pain, even with the assistance
of Bill Seuer's &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html"&gt;MAKECHAR&lt;/a&gt; program.  (Let us just say
that the main villain of the campaign, and evil wizard, ended up a
1000 point character, and all the PCs were 300 point characters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosium: &lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Prince
Valiant&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Pendragon&lt;/cite&gt;, Universal Supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a short &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; campaign after my &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt;
campaign.  This worked better for my players than &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, as it used
simpler implementation of Chaosium's house system, &lt;cite&gt;BRP&lt;/cite&gt;.  Despite
the brevity of this campaign I have fond memories of &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="part-ii-hiatus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part II: Hiatus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that there was a hiatus in my gaming.  I continued to buy and
read RPG material, but didn't have a regular group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this is rambling and desperately needs rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFRP — First encounted in WD?  Then bought main rulebook.  At
first dismissive of the rules, but again fascinated by the picture
of the old world and the high quality of some of the adventures.
The one time I tried running WFRP things didn't work out with
my gaming group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my buying WFRP was during my hiatus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really only came to understand &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; during my hiatus from
gaming, in the 90s, when I started seriously to track down the &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;
material I'd never know about, including the post RQ3 fanzines.  I
even found a copy of &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt; in a game store in Austin, Texas, while there
on travel for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; found … earlier than &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, later? but only understood much later
in 90s during my serious &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; buying days after I ran a long &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; campaign
(&lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;/&lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; helped understand/like RQ?) and bought &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt;.
Early GURPS gaming at college BAMF?
Compare to dates of Alusia becoming &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tékumel.  Call of Cthulhu. Jorune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="part-iii-gaming-again"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part III: Gaming Again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiatus ends.  &lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bunnies &amp;amp; Burrows&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Buggin&lt;/cite&gt;, Toon,
&lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eric_Holmes"&gt;John Eric Holmes&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Fantasy Role
Playing Games - Dungeons, Dragons and Adventures in Fantasy Gaming&lt;/cite&gt;
(ISBN 0-88254-514-0) at work leads to other gamers, and some
&lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 3.5e and &lt;cite&gt;Star Wars D20&lt;/cite&gt; gaming, and eventually to &lt;cite&gt;Savage
Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my hiatus from gaming, I was looking for simpler games.
&lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, and finally &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro-gaming: interest in early classic &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules we missed
(which lead to &lt;cite&gt;Wilderlands&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Tegel Manor&lt;/cite&gt; then &lt;cite&gt;Badabaskor&lt;/cite&gt;,
&lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, etc.  then 3e/3.5e reprints) which lead to
buying lots of PDF games including classic &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; module B10 (superb!)
leading to RC purchases, then other &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules and &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules,
pondering running &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B20, then buying &lt;cite&gt;Thunder Rift&lt;/cite&gt;, Mystara
interest online maps, retro clones to original D&amp;amp;D interest, buy PDFs
from rpgnow, pondering running &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/cite&gt;, download
retro modules for &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, philotomy, other current &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; player/gm
sites/campaigns/blogs, more JG and understanding which JG were &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;,
more pondering &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B10 and other B/X modules, and finding the
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, by Paul Jaquays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road building costs in JG Ready-Ref sheets!  (PDF just as confusing as
I remember printouts! Did Ray end up with them?) [2019-11-10: I ended
up buying a new copy of the Ready-Ref sheets over the internet several
years later!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parallel thread: tactile pleasures: card, bennies, status chips,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;custom poker chips for wounds, shaken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  After the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; started to
appear, especially &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt;, I bought the Moldvay/Cook
&lt;cite&gt;Basic/Expert&lt;/cite&gt; rules, and was pleasantly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tnt"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We completely missing out on the flexibility of the T&amp;amp;T
saving roll system — not surprising, since we never saw any of the
T&amp;amp;T solos that used it so extensively — and how that gave T&amp;amp;T gamist
tactical play without complicated rules, unlike D&amp;amp;D 3e and 3.5e.  I
think we'd have played T&amp;amp;T more if we'd understood that, but I
only really understood after reading some of comments Ron Edwards
made about T&amp;amp;T in 2003, first in the rpg.net thread &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;amp;threadid=46923"&gt;Sell me Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls!&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=858516&amp;amp;postcount=13"&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;), and
then in a series of followup threads at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/"&gt;the Forge&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6272"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6355"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7104"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7863"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
