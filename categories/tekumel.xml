Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for grins and giggles, last time my local gaming group met I
brought copies of the first three commercially published roleplaying
games for show and tell: Original &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Empire of the
Petal Throne&lt;/em&gt;; and &lt;em&gt;Tunnels and Trolls&lt;/em&gt;.  (The order of the last two
is debatable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of 4E and the choruses of “It's not real D&amp;amp;D” had actually
interested me in looking back at what D&amp;amp;D really was, so I bought PDFs
of Original D&amp;amp;D (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/"&gt;RPGNow&lt;/a&gt;) and its supplements and printed them all
out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the original
form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to the Whartson Hall Gamers playing &lt;em&gt;Empire of the Petal
Throne&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgmp3.com/"&gt;RPGMP3&lt;/a&gt; Community Podcast rekindled my interesting in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tekumel.com/"&gt;Tékumel&lt;/a&gt;, so I bought a PDF of it from RPGNow and printed it.  (This
really drove home how much bigger and better presented EPT was than
OD&amp;amp;D.  Also, how even less Politically Correct it was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_and_Trolls"&gt;T&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; had been in my thoughts since Ron Edwards' wrote a series
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6272"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6355"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7104"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=7863"&gt;T&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; game.  I played T&amp;amp;T a bit in my youth,
so I already had a copy of it, the 5th edition, so I let that stand in
for the 1st edition, a not unreasonable bit of flexibility, since T&amp;amp;T
seems to have changed much less over five editions than D&amp;amp;D did over
4.5 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Later: I can't imagine why I didn't bring my copy of FFE/QLI's
republication of the original Traveller Books 1, 2, and 3 along, and
have one of the first SF RPGs too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>d&amp;d</category><category>gaming</category><category>t&amp;t</category><category>tekumel</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/01/triad-odnd-tekumel-tnt/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2008 04:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My Gaming Career</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is unfinished, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="part-i-origins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part I: Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I owned was the Holmes blue-box edition of &lt;cite&gt;Basic
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;; the first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I played was &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E.  I was in junior
high when I got the Holmes box set for Christmas from my parents.  (If
I am remembering correctly.)  That summer I started playing &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
with a group of my brother's friends from high school, and I played
with them until that group gradually dispersed, some when they left
the state for college, and some when they left the state after college
for jobs elsewhere.  I had long been DMing by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldritch_Wizardry"&gt;Eldritch Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; in the local
hobby store when I first started playing, but I never saw the original
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I ever looked at the later Moldvay/Cook or Mentzer
&lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; lines, other than buying &lt;cite&gt;Isle of Dread&lt;/cite&gt;, thinking like
many that if I was already playing &lt;cite&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; that &lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
wouldn't have much to offer. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#basic-dnd" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My younger brother joined the group at some point.  He got &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp;
Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; as a Christmas present one year, from my uncle Chuckie, if I
remember correctly.  We played it several times, but it was a simpler
game than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and at the time seemed to offer less, though in an
entertaining way. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#tnt" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, 1st edition, was probably the first RPG I bought, other
than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.  (How did we buy the &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; books?) We never played
&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, for some reason.  Probably because I wasn't able to
figure out the rules, or because it was too gonzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still in junior high, or perhaps my first year in high school, I
ran across &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.  Although it was written in a “numbered
rules” style that I was unfamiliar with (having never played wargames)
that required me to read it closely several times through before I
understood any of it, I was fascinated by it from the very first read.
&lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;'s skills gave all characters interesting distinguishing
abilities, where as in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; only thieves had similar such abilities
(other classes depending on selection of spells to distinguish the
magic using classes and magic items to distinguish the others.)  The
D100 based unified mechanic used by &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; was also very attractive, as
was the more detailed combat system.  The professional skills seemed
less restrictive and therefore less of a mere game construct than the
equivalent &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; classes.  The fact that every character could learn
magic also seemed freeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the only &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure that I was able to find at the
time was Paul Jaquays' &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; was also a plus, because I
found it to be head and shoulders above any other adventure I had seen
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can seen now that  most of these things I liked about &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; were the
things that added to greater detail in distinguishing characters, as
well as what I called realism them, but today might more accurately
call verisimilitude.  I think a good part of it was that by this time
&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; had become its own genre and I wanted something less tied to
those particular tropes.  &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; seemed to simulate a wider variety of
fantasy than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to say that I was suffering from an anti-D&amp;amp;D
backlash at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I bought a copy of Avalon Hill's &lt;cite&gt;Powers &amp;amp; Perils&lt;/cite&gt;.  (If
my memory of buying this from the hobby store in downtown Clarksburg
is correct, I must have bought this fairly early on in my gaming
career.)  At some other point I bought Iron Crown's &lt;cite&gt;Rolemaster&lt;/cite&gt;.
Both of these blew my mind with complexity.  &lt;cite&gt;P&amp;amp;P&lt;/cite&gt;'s setting, however,
was another glimpse at a non-&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; fantasy universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine bought &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; early in our gaming careers.  We
tried making characters a couple of times, but were never able to
figure out what we should do with them afterwards — I think we could
never bridge the gap between dungeon crawling and monsters killing
characters in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and 40– and 50– year old ex military characters
in Traveller.  I don't think we had any &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; adventures to
help us along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a very successful &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; campaign in my first year at
college with three of the original group and a couple of other
players, using Paul Jaquays' wonderful &lt;cite&gt;Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; adventure
setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in college I started a long-running campaign set in SPI's
minimal &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt; setting using &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; at the
beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My leaning to greater detail and verisimilitude lead me in time to
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, with a small detour along the way for 3rd edition
&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Where did I buy RQ? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, 3rd edition (&lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, the Deluxe Boxed Set) and
&lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt; (also a boxed set) in stores, somewhere.  (I think
this must have been near the time they were released.)  Like
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, I found them fascinating.  Unlike &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; I never got my
group to successfully play &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt;.  The players found &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; character
generation to be too complicated, alas.  &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;
were a glimpse into a style of culture-based gaming that I had never
encountered in my &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; experience, but were complicated enough that
my players hated character generation, and we never got much beyond
that.  I never saw &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the Glorantha materials until much, much
later, post Internet.  &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;, though, even with the
occasional incoherence in its Glorantha-less state, resonated with
more depth than anything I had yet seen.  (I never realized, until
years later, that the Paul Jaquays whose &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted
Wood&lt;/cite&gt; had so opened my eyes was also one of the authors of &lt;cite&gt;Griffin
Island&lt;/cite&gt;!  I guess at the time I didn't pay much attention to the
authors/designers of games.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; for me was about even more finely grained definition of
characters.  Learning from problems my players had with &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;
character generation, I created &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; versions of all their
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; characters.  Since, in the process of simulating all
their &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; abilities with &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, I'd along the way upgraded their
characters somewhat in power, everybody had fun and it all worked out.
Already accustomed to a hex-based tactical combat system and
role-under skills from &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;, it was an easy adjustment to &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, and
the campaign continued successfully for many more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, however, that later I moved away from &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; because
making/updating characters was such a pain, even with the assistance
of Bill Seuer's &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html"&gt;MAKECHAR&lt;/a&gt; program.  (Let us just say
that the main villain of the campaign, and evil wizard, ended up a
1000 point character, and all the PCs were 300 point characters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosium: &lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Prince
Valiant&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Pendragon&lt;/cite&gt;, Universal Supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a short &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; campaign after my &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt;
campaign.  This worked better for my players than &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, as it used
simpler implementation of Chaosium's house system, &lt;cite&gt;BRP&lt;/cite&gt;.  Despite
the brevity of this campaign I have fond memories of &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="part-ii-hiatus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part II: Hiatus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that there was a hiatus in my gaming.  I continued to buy and
read RPG material, but didn't have a regular group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this is rambling and desperately needs rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFRP — First encounted in WD?  Then bought main rulebook.  At
first dismissive of the rules, but again fascinated by the picture
of the old world and the high quality of some of the adventures.
The one time I tried running WFRP things didn't work out with
my gaming group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my buying WFRP was during my hiatus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really only came to understand &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; during my hiatus from
gaming, in the 90s, when I started seriously to track down the &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;
material I'd never know about, including the post RQ3 fanzines.  I
even found a copy of &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt; in a game store in Austin, Texas, while there
on travel for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; found … earlier than &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, later? but only understood much later
in 90s during my serious &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; buying days after I ran a long &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; campaign
(&lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;/&lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; helped understand/like RQ?) and bought &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt;.
Early GURPS gaming at college BAMF?
Compare to dates of Alusia becoming &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tékumel.  Call of Cthulhu. Jorune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="part-iii-gaming-again"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part III: Gaming Again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiatus ends.  &lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bunnies &amp;amp; Burrows&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Buggin&lt;/cite&gt;, Toon,
&lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eric_Holmes"&gt;John Eric Holmes&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Fantasy Role
Playing Games - Dungeons, Dragons and Adventures in Fantasy Gaming&lt;/cite&gt;
(ISBN 0-88254-514-0) at work leads to other gamers, and some
&lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 3.5e and &lt;cite&gt;Star Wars D20&lt;/cite&gt; gaming, and eventually to &lt;cite&gt;Savage
Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my hiatus from gaming, I was looking for simpler games.
&lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, and finally &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro-gaming: interest in early classic &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules we missed
(which lead to &lt;cite&gt;Wilderlands&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Tegel Manor&lt;/cite&gt; then &lt;cite&gt;Badabaskor&lt;/cite&gt;,
&lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, etc.  then 3e/3.5e reprints) which lead to
buying lots of PDF games including classic &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; module B10 (superb!)
leading to RC purchases, then other &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules and &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules,
pondering running &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B20, then buying &lt;cite&gt;Thunder Rift&lt;/cite&gt;, Mystara
interest online maps, retro clones to original D&amp;amp;D interest, buy PDFs
from rpgnow, pondering running &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/cite&gt;, download
retro modules for &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, philotomy, other current &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; player/gm
sites/campaigns/blogs, more JG and understanding which JG were &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;,
more pondering &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B10 and other B/X modules, and finding the
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, by Paul Jaquays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road building costs in JG Ready-Ref sheets!  (PDF just as confusing as
I remember printouts! Did Ray end up with them?) [2019-11-10: I ended
up buying a new copy of the Ready-Ref sheets over the internet several
years later!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parallel thread: tactile pleasures: card, bennies, status chips,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  After the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; started to
appear, especially &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt;, I bought the Moldvay/Cook
&lt;cite&gt;Basic/Expert&lt;/cite&gt; rules, and was pleasantly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tnt"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We completely missing out on the flexibility of the T&amp;amp;T
saving roll system — not surprising, since we never saw any of the
T&amp;amp;T solos that used it so extensively — and how that gave T&amp;amp;T gamist
tactical play without complicated rules, unlike D&amp;amp;D 3e and 3.5e.  I
think we'd have played T&amp;amp;T more if we'd understood that, but I
only really understood after reading some of comments Ron Edwards
made about T&amp;amp;T in 2003, first in the rpg.net thread &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;amp;threadid=46923"&gt;Sell me Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls!&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=858516&amp;amp;postcount=13"&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;), and
then in a series of followup threads at

&lt;h2&gt;Recent Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witherwing&lt;/em&gt;, by David Jarret; Warner Books, September 1979.  This is
one of those books that is more interesting for the glimpses of the
underpinnings of the setting than for anything that the characters do
or that happens to them. Enjoyable in an abstract way, for someone
interested in Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="sword-sorcery-roleplaying"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery Roleplaying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;em&gt;Witherwing&lt;/em&gt; because, like Gardener F. Fox's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/02/21/2005-02-21-recent-reading-and-viewing/#kothar"&gt;Kothar&lt;/a&gt;, it was in the
reading list of Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery books in the &lt;em&gt;Sorcerer &amp;amp; Sword&lt;/em&gt;
supplement for the &lt;em&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying game, both which were
written by Ron Edwards. It was listed as one of the references for the
“Mutant-Future” example setting. &lt;em&gt;Sorcerer &amp;amp; Sword&lt;/em&gt; (as is typical
of &lt;em&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/em&gt; and its supplments) approaches Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery very
differently from most roleplaying games: it concentrates on the
original Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery authors (for instance, it considers only
those &lt;em&gt;Conan&lt;/em&gt; stories actually written by Robert E. Howard, which by
now is probably the smaller part of the &lt;em&gt;Conan&lt;/em&gt; series), includes RPG
mechanics only for things that can't be handled by concepts from other
RPGs, ignores the loot and level basis of the widespread monster-
killing style of roleplaying, &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/03/05/2005-03-05/#id3" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and only including things that will
be directly useful in play. This later means, for instance, that there
is no detailed, specific background material included, since it takes
than stance that most of that material is never used in play. Instead,
there are examples of starting with a minimal setting and creating the
details during play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I thoroughly recommend &lt;em&gt;Sorcerer &amp;amp; Sword&lt;/em&gt; for anyone who
is playing grim, intense, Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery-based roleplaying games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as source material for “Mutant-Future” games, &lt;em&gt;Witherwing&lt;/em&gt; is
full of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="tekumel-roleplaying"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tékumel Roleplaying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read more of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com/"&gt;Guardians of Order&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;em&gt;Tékumel: Empire of the
Petal Throne&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying game and it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good. I've noticed a
few typos so far, but nothing serious, and the game itself seems
pretty clearly explained. Moreover, the world background material is
very good. The old &lt;em&gt;Swords and Glory&lt;/em&gt;, Volume 1, the &lt;em&gt;Tékumel
Sourcebook&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/03/05/2005-03-05/#id4" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; still has more detailed information, but the new game
provides a distilled essence that provides enough detail for newcomers
to understand Tékumel and have some idea of how to play a character
from the setting. It concentrates on Tsolyánu, which is the area of
Tékumel on which we have the most information, and has information
for the more common non-human races as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, the system is derived from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com/"&gt;Guardians of Order&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com/games/tristat/"&gt;Tri-Stat&lt;/a&gt;
game system,
although it uses 1d10 instead of 2d6 or 2d&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, and it uses 6
stats, instead of 3. The list of attributes available to starting
characters has been simplified and specialized for Tékumel and the
skills list has been expanded and specialized for Tékumel. Magic is
handled separately with a system that seems to capture the flavor of
Tékumel's ritual and spell-based magic very well. Character creation
includes those social aspects that dominate Tsolyánu culture: clans
and careers in the legions, temples, or government, as well as an
extensive subsytem for dealing with resources, a subject which can be
complicated in Tsolyánu since property tends to be owned by the clan
rather than individuals, as well as smaller subsystems for dealing
with teamwork, respect, and favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'd say the game is somewhat crunchier than BESM (there are
stat requirements for weapons and some careers, and spells can have
multiple levels with different enhancements and various specialties),
but much, mucher lighter than &lt;em&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Glory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Garásiyal&lt;/em&gt;, or 3rd
edition &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdict so far: the new game makes me want to play &lt;em&gt;Tékumel: Empire
of the Petal Throne&lt;/em&gt;, and provides the right material so that it's
possible to see how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="id3"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/03/05/2005-03-05/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, as some have assumed, that the author is
against loot and level gaming: he elsewhere praises &lt;em&gt;T&amp;amp;T&lt;/em&gt;, which is
one of the most loot and level based games of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="id4"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/03/05/2005-03-05/#id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is still available from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tekumel.com/tita"&gt;Tita's House of Games&lt;/a&gt;, by the way, and well worth it for
the Tékumel aficionado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I got my copy of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com/"&gt;Guardians of Order&lt;/a&gt;'s new roleplaying game,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com/games/tekumel/"&gt;Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first
time since the original TSR Tékumel roleplaying game that there has
been an edition of the game that was complete and playable in one
book. While I haven't had time to read it completely I've skimmed
through it and it looks very good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>old blog</category><category>rpg</category><category>tekumel</category><category>tekumel: empire of the petal throne</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2005/03/02/2005-03-02/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2005 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Consistent Game Worlds and Levels of Detail</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2003/04/14/2003-04-14/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easier to create a consistent game world if it is not too
detailed, and it is arguably easier to start playing in such a world,
since each roleplaying game group will create their own vision of the
world with their own details, and will feel a greater connection to
the world and it's unfolding history.  However, if game play generates
additional detail (as opposed to simply generating new history) then
inconsitences can arise.  This is not a problem for gamers who don't
care about details at all, but most care at least a little about the
details: they don't want taverns to switch from one side of the river
to another, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gaming in more detailed worlds, the gamers have to expend more
effort up front to work within the details: learning how &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tekumel.com/"&gt;Tékumel&lt;/a&gt;
societies work, or the religions of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://glorantha.fandom.com/wiki/Lunar_Empire"&gt;Lunar Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Glorantha,
but the additional detail can add depth to the roleplaying experience
and can provide additional inspiration for the game.  How can such
detail be best presented to prevent the gamer from becoming overloaded
and turned away by the detail? Is it possible to present things in
such a way that there is as little up front work for the gamer to
start playing in a detailed world as an undetailed world, and can the
continuing effort of working within the details be kept close to the
level of effort required to play in an undetailed world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>glorantha</category><category>old blog</category><category>tekumel</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2003/04/14/2003-04-14/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2003 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
