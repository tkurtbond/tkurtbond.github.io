&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&amp;amp;D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.

any new D&amp;amp;D campaign I start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4056920456"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the classes, races, spells, and other player facing rules of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must admit I miss the monk, and the two Hit Dice at first level of the Ranger from AD&amp;amp;D 1E, but I suppose the former is out because of the common perception that it doesn't thematically fit the pseudo-medieval setting of most D&amp;amp;D games, and the latter is part of adapting to the scale of B/X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome is another excellent presentation of the classic rules in a well designed and sturdy hard back book. I'm impressed with the organization and clarity of the presentation. I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic player rules.
