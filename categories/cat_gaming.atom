My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4130207047"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are looking for a way to customize existing classes or create new classes for B/X D&amp;amp;D style games, especially Old-School Essentials, this book is a wonderful resource. It breaks the original classes down into their fundamental parts and provides a simple system for building those parts into new or customized classes. It presents the breakdown for each of the original classes, then provides a list of class variants, customized versions of the original class, as well as sub-classes, heavily redesigned classes. For instance, for the Cleric, the class variants are: Cleric (Dead God), Cleric (God of Death), Cleric (God of Knowledge), Cleric (God of Life), Cleric (God of Nature), and Cleric (God of War); and the sub-classes are Crusader and Shaman. Class variants and sub-classes are presented for Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfling, Magic-User, and Thief. It also provides a version of Thief skills using the d6, other d6 skills that can be used in creating classes, some additional armour, weapons, and ammunition, an optional table for spell failure in appropriate circumstances (for example, when non-casters read a spell scroll), a table of special abilities gained by classes that have animal companions, differing depending on the animal in question, and options for characters to gain at high levels, beyond the limits of their level progression tables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll definitely be using this in my next B/X-style game!

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple improvement on B/X D&amp;amp;D and OD&amp;amp;D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I've wished
that the B/X and OD&amp;amp;D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions, like that of AD&amp;amp;D.  As it
is, you have to read the spell description to figure out if a saving
throw is allowed and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Basic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Core&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Whitebox&lt;/cite&gt;; and &lt;cite&gt;Delving
Deeper&lt;/cite&gt;, all fail to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; surprised that &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In AFF 1E armour didn't make magic harder</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/07/06/another-thing-i-really-liked-about-advanced-fighting-fantasy-1e/"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; to Axel Wolfric, one of the example characters for
Advanced Fighting Fantasy 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Edition, he has spells
despite being a sorcery-hating barbarian.  This works in AFF 1E
because &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; Hero and adversary is assumed to be wearing
appropriate armour.  If they &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; their armour then all rolls on
the Damage Table against them adds 2 to the roll.  (See &lt;cite&gt;Dungeoner&lt;/cite&gt;,
p. 163 and 164.  That's also where it talks about shields.)  So any
character can put points into the &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; Special Skill (at the cost
of reducing their SKILL characteristic by an equal amount), so anybody
can have magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always liked fantasy RPG systems where anybody can cast spells.
(Thanks, &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn't work as well in Advanced Fighting Fantasy
2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Edition.  AFF 2E allows anybody to put points into the
MAGIC characteristic (similarly reducing the number of points that can
be allocated to other characteristics), but casting spells in armour
requires additional magic points, the better the armour the more magic
points must be spent.  (See &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Fighting Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;
Edition, p. 72, bottom of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; column and the top of the
2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; column.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how much it would affect things in a game if I just ignored
that rule?  I'll have to try it sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="later"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that takes away some from the users of Sorcery in AFF 2E,
who spend STAMINA instead of MAGIC POINTS to cast a completely
different set of spells than Wizardry, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can cast in armour.
Hmm.  I'll have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, I didn't realize that monks in OD&amp;amp;D and AD&amp;amp;D 1E can't use
potions!  (And scrolls, but that didn't surprise me.)  OD&amp;amp;D states it
explicitly on page 3 of &lt;cite&gt;Blackmoor&lt;/cite&gt;.  AD&amp;amp;D 1E doesn't state it
explicitly, but they are not among the allowed magic items listed
(appropriate weapons, rings, and miscellaneous magic that can be used
by theives) and it says all other magic items are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have do not know if this is how we played AD&amp;amp;D 1E back in the day.
I have a sneaking suspicion that we missed this restriction, but I
just don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;cite&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete&lt;/cite&gt; that clued me into this, as I was
comparing the monk class in it with AD&amp;amp;D 1E, and then I confirmed it
in OD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; differences among all the editions of pre-3E D&amp;amp;D!
Some are quite subtle, but really change how things play: no healing
potions for monks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

    <title>Color versus Black and White Art in RPGs</title>
    <id>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/07/11/color-versus-black-and-white-art-in-rpgs/</id>
    <updated>2021-07-11T21:33:53-04:00</updated>
    <published>2021-07-11T21:33:53-04:00</published>

      <name>T. Kurt Bond</name>
    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/07/11/color-versus-black-and-white-art-in-rpgs/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently read of a review of an RPG that criticized it for having
black and white art as well as color art.  I think this is misguided,
for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I like black and white art.  It takes skill to do properly, and
can be very effective at setting a mood or providing inspiration.  The
RPG that the review mentioned above was about used color art for full
pages or double page spreads, and I thought it was very effective and
attractive.  I also found the use of black and white art on the other
pages, mostly taking up part of a page, very effective and
attractive.  I don't mind the mix, if it is done in a manner that
harmonizes well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I don't mind RPG materials that contain only black and white
art.  Again, if the art is good, then it improves the work, and is
welcome to the eyes.  Some RPG publishers simply don't have the money
for full color art throughout the work.  I don't think it is fair to
criticize their work simply on the basis that it isn't full color.  In
fact, if the work is well written and has no art I'm more likely to
enjoy it and get what I want from it than if it is badly written and
has good art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, if the work has pages that are completely covered from edge
to edge, especially on the paper used for the best reproduction of
color art, the ink is much more likely to smear and leave ugly tracks
from normal handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifthly, fully covered pages often have background art
that reduces the readability of the page.  For instance, the brown
background to the first page of chapters in D&amp;amp;D 3E and 3.5E, and the
broken brown lines under the text of the other pages in the chapters
detracts from the readability noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixthly, when working with maps for RPGs, while I find judicious use
of color to make things stand out is useful, I find that maps that are
fully colored, while impressive to look at, are much harder to adapt
and to record changes on.  When I run “B2 Keep on the Borderlands” or
Jennell Jaquay's “Dark Tower” I can write notes directly on the map
and draw in changes such as collapsed sections or new excavations.  I
can't do that with full color printed art — the changes don't show up
well or in some cases at all, depending on the paper and the ink used.
This is less important if working with digital images, because you can
always use sharply contrasting colors for text and line drawings, but
full color “painted” battle maps are harder to &lt;em&gt;adapt&lt;/em&gt; for most people
because the skill it takes to modify it and have it looks good is much
greater than most people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I don't think color art, especially full color pages, is a
requirement for good RPG books and materials.  It is impressive when
it is used well, but can actually be a drawback in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
