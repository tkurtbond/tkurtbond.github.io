    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been hearing a lot of people saying, in effect, that 4E D&amp;amp;D
admits what kind of game D&amp;amp;D has always been and tunes everything for
that: butt-kicking tactical battle-mat kick-in-the-door, kill
everything, and take it's stuff gamist play. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#whatpodcast" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Right now
I'm ignoring the later bit about what 4E does and how well it does it,
and looking at the earlier bit's claims about “the kind of game D&amp;amp;D
has always been”.  I'm not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, right now, is sort of a placeholder.  I intend to fill in
my history with D&amp;amp;D and look at the various editions of D&amp;amp;D that I've
got and see if they support the “the kind of game D&amp;amp;D has always been”
remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/01/triad-odnd-tekumel-tnt/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; the release of 4E and the choruses of “It's
not real D&amp;amp;D” actually got me interested me in looking back at what
D&amp;amp;D really was, so I bought PDFs of Original D&amp;amp;D (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/"&gt;RPGNow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#wotc-kerfluffle" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) and its supplements and Chainmail and printed
them all out and bound them in 8.5”x5” pamphlets, in more or less the
original form factor.  I've read &lt;cite&gt;Chainmail&lt;/cite&gt; and the three pamphlets
that made up the original D&amp;amp;D release (X, Y, Z) completely, and have
scanned the others.  (Oddly enough, I've still not got beyond scanning
4E.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="od-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of D&amp;amp;D, along with some of its supplements, was
still available in some hobby shops when I started playing RPGs, but
the group I played with had was strictly AD&amp;amp;D, so I completely missed
out playing the original, as well as its follow-ons, the various
versions of Basic D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the retrogaming community has commented that the play
experience for this for this version of D&amp;amp;D is very different from all
versions that came after it.  From my initial reading, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blue-box-holmes-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blue Box/Holmes D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this boxed set for Christmas one year as a young teenager, and
was fascinated.  My box came with B2 — The Keep on the Borderlands.
The group I ended up with, however, played AD&amp;amp;D.  I think I ran this a
couple of times for my younger brother.  My original copy of the
rulebook walked off many years ago, but I picked up the reproduction
cheap a year or so after the anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="moldvay-cook-basic-expert-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moldvay/Cook Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this in stores as a teenager, but never picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a copy of the rulebooks (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nobleknight.com/"&gt;Noble Knight&lt;/a&gt;) at some point,
and can see why so many speak so fondly of it.  It is a clear, well
written presentation of the ideas from OD&amp;amp;D with the unevenness sanded
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="advanced-d-d-1e"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D, 1E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my real introduction to roleplaying games, and continued as
the main game in the groups where I played until college, with
occasional bouts of Tunnels and Trolls.  We played mostly homegrown
campaigns; for some reason the AD&amp;amp;D modules didn't work as well for
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="red-box-mentzer-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Box/Mentzer D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got a chance to play Red Box, but I got the PDFs from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgnow.com/"&gt;RPGNow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rules-cyclopedia-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules Cyclopedia D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a lot of folks extolling the virtues of the one-book RC D&amp;amp;D,
so I searched around a found a reasonably priced copy.  Well worth the
money.  This is without a doubt the most complete-in-one-book version
of D&amp;amp;D, at least until the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="advanced-d-d-2e"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D, 2E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When 2E came out I'd long since moved on from D&amp;amp;D, and had been
playing &lt;em&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GURPS&lt;/em&gt; for long while.  I played 2E very
briefly, just before 3E came out, with a guy who'd been on a 3E
playtest and hated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="e-d-d"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3E D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely missed playing this at the time, but have played a few
sessions during the 3.5E era with folks who played 3E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.5E D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played this a fair bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="whatpodcast"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;What podcast did I hear this on?  Voice of the
Revolution, said by Paul Tevis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="wotc-kerfluffle"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/10/06/4e-dnd-admits-what-game-its-always-been/#id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when they were still available legally,
before the WotC PDF kerfluffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
