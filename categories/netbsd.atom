    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did a fresh install of NetBSD 5.1.2 and tried to install emacs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;# pkg_add emacs
pkg_add: Error: package `emacs-24.0.50.20110821' was built with a newer pkg_install version
pkg_add: 1 package addition failed&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I installed pkgsrc and did a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkg_install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I added &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the front of my path,
and tried again.  That seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some odd reason I decided to power on my old Gateway 2000 486DX/33
and do something with it.  It hadn't been on since Wednesday, May
25th, 2005, if I can believe the BIOS date.  (I was pleasantly
surprised the settings hadn't gotten corrupted.)  Up to the point I turned it
off it was acting as a mail server backup for my personal system, and
was running Sendmail, Dovecot, a greylisting milter, and Emacs.  A
little before that it had actually been one of the MPL DNS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it had Windows 95 on the original 200MB IDE hard drive and
FreeBSD 4.10 on the 2GB Quantum XP32275S Atlas II.  It came with
Windows 95 of course when I bought it, but I ran &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System"&gt;SLS Linux&lt;/a&gt; on it
originally, if I remember correctly, because 386BSD wouldn't install,
and later &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCC_Interim_Linux"&gt;MCC Interim Linux&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.  When my wife got
me the SCSI controler and CD-ROM I was so thrilled because now I
wouldn't get dragging home OS distributions on floppy any more!  Once
I got the 2GB hard drive I put Windows 95 back on the 200MB drive for
my wife and for the occastional work-related Windows 95 excursion.  It
had 16MB originally, but I scrounged 4MB more of RAM for it very late
on, when it was a DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get a more recent OS on it, but remembering how FreeBSD
4.10 was a pretty tight fight there at the end, I decided I'd put
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.netbsd.org/"&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt; on it.  (NetBSD documentation says it still should be possible to
run in 4MB.)   I used NetBSD for a while for my main box at home, but
I was never satisfied that I'd mastered it as well as FreeBSD, and I
thought this would be good way to put the old 486 to work.  Luckily I
was albe to find an 3c509B card to get it on the network, because it
turned out the 3.5” floppy and the CD-ROM drive were both
non-functional.  (As I worked with the machine I remembered the floppy
had been bad when I'd turned it off, but the CD-ROM had been working.)
I gathered some confirmation information and then started trying to
figure out how I was going to get NetBSD on it.  Luckily the FreeBSD
4.10 install was still working and I was able to extract the NetBSD
dosboot.com bootloader  from base.tgz, copy it and the netbsd-install
kernel over the network with FreeBSD, mount the
old 200MB Windows 95/MS-DOS disk under FreeBSD, and copy the files
over there, then boot into MS-DOS with F8 when Windows 95 started to
boot, run through the prompting for each line in the config files and
answering “NO”, and then run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dosboot &lt;span class="pre"&gt;netbsd-install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation was successful, but unfortunately the boot process failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recall, I've had problems in the past getting boot loaders to
boot off this drive.  I'll have to revisit it when I have some more
time.&lt;/p&gt;
