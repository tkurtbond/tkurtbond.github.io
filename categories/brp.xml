Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4541318/Roman-sling-bullets-deadly-44-Magnum.html?fbclid=IwAR2IZhVYW4-4_BcuQDOq2yGXwwurzBd3HNSo1BzN7XUwZLKHF4XZ54yy0VU"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, headlined “Roman sling bullets
used against Scottish tribes 2,000 years ago were as deadly as a .44
Magnum”, I was thinking about slings in RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often thought that sling bullets are woefully nerfed in many
RPGs, especially D&amp;amp;D.  In D&amp;amp;D 5E, for instance, they're only 1d4,
while a short bow is 1d6 and a long bow is 1d8. For comparison,
daggers are 1d4 and longswords are 1d8.  In OD&amp;amp;D using Greyhawk's
“Damage Done by Weapon Type” table sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; are 1d4, and the
same in B/X D&amp;amp;D's optional “Variable Weapon Damage” table.  AD&amp;amp;D has
sling &lt;em&gt;bullets&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4+1 and sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4.  D&amp;amp;D 3.5E has them
as 1d4.  So the D&amp;amp;D editions pretty consistently have it as
1d4. Definitely nerfed.  Except in 3-book OD&amp;amp;D and B/X D&amp;amp;D without the
“Variable Weapon Damage” table, where all weapons did 1d6 damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; slings are Str+d4, while a bow is 2d6.  For
comparison, a dagger is Str+d4 and a long sword is Str+d8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneQuest"&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt; 2E they are 1d8, similar to a Composite bow at 1d8+1
and broadsword at 1d8.  In Elric! (a member of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer_(role-playing_game)"&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/a&gt; line
of games, appearing between 4th Edition and 5th Edition, but the rules
were substantially equivalent to Stormbringer 5E; It is relative of
RuneQuest mechanically, part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; family
of games) a sling is 1d8+1, similar to a Desert Recurve Bow at 1d8+2,
and a broadsword at 1d8+1.  So in the BRP games they are not nerfed.
In DragonQuest their Damage Modifier is +1, while a dagger is +0, a
long bow is +4 and a broadsword is +4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talislanta"&gt;Talislanta&lt;/a&gt; 4E a sling's Damage Rating is 4, as is a dagger, while a
long bow and broadsword are 8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; 5E, sling damage is 1d6+1, same as a medium bow or a light
long bow, while a medium long bow is 1 ½ d6 (that's 1 and ½ d6)
and a heavy long bow is 2d6.  A dagger is 1d6-1 and a broadsword is
1d6+1.  Note that strong enough characters add damage to this based on
how strong they are. Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS#Prior_RPG_history"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 4E, damage is based on your strength, and the only dice used is
d6.  We'll use an average Strength 10 character as an example.  Their
Thrust damage is 1d-2 and their Swing damage is 1d. An opponent's
Damage Resistance (DR) is subtracted from the rolled damage and any
damage left is multiplied by a modifier for each type of damage.
Piercing damage has a ×1 modifier, cutting has a ×1.5 modifier, and
impaling has a ×2 modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sling damage is swing piercing, and the damage for that for our
average character is 1d.  A longbow is thrust+2 impaling. and the
damage for that is 1d, and whatever makes it past DR is doubled.  A
regular bow is thrust+1 impaling, and the damage for that is 1d+1
(minus DR) ×2.  A dagger is thrust-1 impaling, so that is 1d-3 (minus
DR) ×2.  A thrusting broadsword is swing+1 cutting (1d+1 (minus DR)
×1.5) or thrust+2 impaling (1d+2 (minus DR) ×2).  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that's
nerfed a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'd like to note that when actually playing GURPS I think this is
simpler to do at the table than it sounds like. The damage values for
each attack is figured out at character creation :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasy_Trip"&gt;The Fantasy Trip&lt;/a&gt;, which like GURPS only uses d6, slings do
1d-2, small bows do 1d-1, longbows do 1d+2, daggers do 1d-1, and
broadswords do 2d.  A little bit nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth"&gt;Big Eyes Small Mouth (BESM)&lt;/a&gt; 2nd Edition Revised, slings are not
listed, but a long bow does 5 damage, a longsword does 10 damage, and
a dagger does 5 damage.  In BESM 3rd Edition, an average person has an
Attack Combat Value (ACV) of 4 and a Damage Multiplier of 5.  Each weapon has
a Level, which is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier and added to the
ACV for the final damage.  Slings are Level 1 (1 × 5 + 4 = 9), as are
daggers.  Longbows are Level 3 (3 × 5 + 1 = 16), as are longswords.
Definitely nerfed.  (It is the same in &lt;cite&gt;BESM 4E&lt;/cite&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A2rnMaster"&gt;HarnMaster&lt;/a&gt;, weapon impact (damage) for Melee weapons has three
Aspects, Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A dagger's impact is B
1, E 2, P 5, while a broadsword is B 3, E 5, and P 3.  A Missile
weapon's impact depends on the type of missile weapon and the range:
short, medium, long, and extreme.  Slings are Short 4, Medium 3, Long
2, and Extreme 2.  Shortbows are Short 6, Medium 5, Long 4, Extreme 3.
Longbows are Short 8, Medium 8, Long 6, Extreme 5.  Nerfed.  I'll note
that these weapon or missile impacts are added to a Strike Impact is
decided by a table indexed by how well the attacker did on opposed
rolls of attack skill against the defender's skill in Block,
Counterstrike, Dodge, or if the defender ignored the attack. For Melee
attacks this can result in the defender having blocked the attack,
either the attacker or the defender fumbling or stumbling, the
defender gaining a Tactical Advantage (a free action), or either or
both having made a Strike, which generates from 1 to 4 d6s.  For
Missle attacks this can result in a Miss (with a chance to hit an
adjacent combatant, a Wild (a fumble roll), a Block, or a Strike,
which generates from 1 to 3 d6s.  The Armor Protection value is
subtracked and the result is the total Effective Impact, which is then
referenced on the Injury Table to determine where the on the body the
injury is and how serious it is.  There are no Hit Points like D&amp;amp;D or
Wounds like Savage Worlds.  Instead the character accumulates injuries
like “1 Minor Slash Left Upper Arm, 1 injury level”.  The total injury
level determines the difficulty of the character staying conscious and
penalty to any skill roll.  Some of the injuries may immediately kill
the injured character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good thread by Robert S. Conley (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batintheattic.blogspot.com/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.batintheattic.com/index.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/22847/robert-conley"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpgpub.com/threads/the-one-where-i-sing-the-praises-of-harnmaster.2363/"&gt;RPG PUB&lt;/a&gt;
that talks some more about HarnMaster combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In West End Games' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D6_Fantasy"&gt;D6 Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, attributes are measured in d6s and 2D
is an average human.  Bow and sling damage and melee damage as d6s
added to a number of d6s determined by your Strength Damage, which is
determined by your Physique attribute or Lifting skill (both measured
in d6s), drop any adds, divided by 2.  So our average human's Strength
Damage is 1D.  Then longbows add +2D+2, shortbows add +1D+2, and
slings add +1D.  For comparison, daggers add +1D and broad/long swords
ad +2D+2.  So, nerfed, although it is hard to make precise
distinctions at this level of resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls"&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/a&gt; only uses d6s and weapons are measured in “Dice +
Adds”, that is the number of d6s to roll and the number of points to
add to the dice total.  The common sling is 2d.  A very light self bow
is 2d, a light self bow is 3d, a medium self bow is 4d, a heavy self
bow is 5d, and a extra-heavy self bow is 6d.  These all have
increasing Strength Required to use the weapon.  For comparison, a
Dirk is 2D+1 and a broadsword is 3d+4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warriors"&gt;Dragon Warriors&lt;/a&gt; weapon damage has two parts: an armor
penetration die (measured in dice: d4, d6, d8, etc.) and damage
points.  The armor penetration die is rolled against the Armour Factor
of the defender's armour: a Gambeson has an Armour Factor of 2 while
Plate has an Armor Factor of 5, and the attacker has to roll &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt;
than the Armour Factor to inflict damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sling has Damage (d6, 3 points) while a Bow has Damage (d6, 4
points).  For comparison, a dagger has Damage (d4, 3 points) and a
sword has Damage (d8, 4 points).  Slightly nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I GM games that I think nerf slings, like D&amp;amp;D, I often use a
house rule that sling bullets are higher damage than sling stones, and
more similar to the damage of a short bow, 1d6, for example.  I may
have been underestimating them and should consider them closer to a
long bow, 1d8, as Chaosium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; variants
(RuneQuest, Elric, Stormbringer) do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="addendum"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2020-03-14 Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Classic_Traveller"&gt;Classic Traveller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Supplement 04 Citizens of the
Imperium&lt;/cite&gt; (1979) has a section on bow weapons, on p. 16!  A sling does
2D wounds and a long bow does 2D wounds also.  For comparison, from
&lt;cite&gt;Book 01 Characters &amp;amp; Combat&lt;/cite&gt; (1981) on p. 47 on the “Range Table” (?)
dagger, blade, cutlass, and sword all do 2D wounds.  Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cepheus Engine&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/237247/Cepheus-Engine-RPG"&gt;C1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.paulelliottbooks.com/what-is-cepheus-engine.html"&gt;C2&lt;/a&gt;) doesn't have slings, but a bow is 2D6.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/304840/The-Sword-of-Cepheus"&gt;Sword of Cepheus&lt;/a&gt;, the fantasy variant, has sling as 2D, short bow
as 2D, long bow as 3D, dagger as 2D, and sword as 3D.  Maybe a little
nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>basic roleplaying</category><category>besm</category><category>big eyes small mouth</category><category>brp</category><category>cepheus engine</category><category>classic traveller</category><category>d6 fantasy</category><category>d&amp;d</category><category>dragon warriors</category><category>dragonquest</category><category>elric!</category><category>gurps</category><category>harnmaster</category><category>hero system</category><category>nerfed</category><category>open d6</category><category>rpg</category><category>runequest</category><category>savage worlds</category><category>slings</category><category>stormbringer</category><category>sword of cepheus</category><category>talislanta</category><category>tft</category><category>the fantasy trip</category><category>tnt</category><category>traveller</category><category>tunnels &amp; trolls</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/07/slings-in-rpgs-often-nerfed/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 19:40:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>RuneQuest Versions</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2012/06/11/runequest-versions/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can never remember the publication dates of the various versions of
&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, so here's a list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; (1978), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chaosium.com"&gt;Chaosium&lt;/a&gt;.  AKA RuneQuest I, RQI, RQ1.  Was set
in the world of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, second edition (1980), Chaosium.  AKA RuneQuest II,
RQII, RQ2.  Was set in the world of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, third edition (1984), Avalon Hill.  AKA RuneQuest III,
RQ3.  Used Fantasy Europe as the example setting, but also had
a lot of Glorantha publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published as a box set, it was republished as a paperback
book in the US in the early 1990s during the brief but productive
RuneQuest Renaissance ushered in by the new RuneQuest editor at
Avalon Hill, Ken Rolston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest: Adventures in Glorantha&lt;/cite&gt;, (never published
commercially), Avalon Hill.  AKA RQIV and RQ:AiG on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; (2006), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/"&gt;Mongoose Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.  AKA MRQ on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was published as an setting-independent fantasy system (under
the OGL), but Mongoose also had a license to publish material about
the “Second Age” of the world of Glorantha and published a lot of
Glorantha specific books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, second edition (2010), Mongoose Publishing. AKA MRQ2 on
the Internet.  (Mongoose called this “RuneQuest II”, and books for
this edition usually have a RQII logo on their cover.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, sixth edition (announced 16 July 2011), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thedesignmechanism.com/"&gt;The Design
Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll not go into the related histories of the related &lt;cite&gt;Basic
Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt; games from Chaosium, nor the completely different system
&lt;cite&gt;HeroQuest&lt;/cite&gt; which also used the setting of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more RuneQuest history see Pete Maranci's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.maranci.net/rqpast.htm"&gt;The History of
RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.maranci.net/rq.htm"&gt;Pete's RuneQuest &amp;amp; Roleplaying!&lt;/a&gt; for more on
RuneQuest in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mongoose released a new RPG, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/legend.html"&gt;Legend&lt;/a&gt;, using the mechanics from their
RuneQuest, second edition, under the OGL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>basic roleplaying</category><category>brp</category><category>chaosium</category><category>heroquest</category><category>history</category><category>legend</category><category>mongoose</category><category>mrq</category><category>mrq2</category><category>rpg</category><category>rq1</category><category>rq2</category><category>rq3</category><category>rq6</category><category>rq:aig</category><category>rqi</category><category>rqii</category><category>rqiii</category><category>rqiv</category><category>runequest</category><category>the design mechanism</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2012/06/11/runequest-versions/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 02:41:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My Gaming Career</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/</link><dc:creator>T.

&lt;p&gt;This post is unfinished, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-i-origins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part I: Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I owned was the Holmes blue-box edition of &lt;cite&gt;Basic
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;; the first &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; game I played was &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E.  I was in junior
high when I got the Holmes box set for Christmas from my parents.  (If
I am remembering correctly.)  That summer I started playing &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
with a group of my brother's friends from high school, and I played
with them until that group gradually dispersed, some when they left
the state for college, and some when they left the state after college
for jobs elsewhere.  I had long been DMing by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldritch_Wizardry"&gt;Eldritch Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; in the local
hobby store when I first started playing, but I never saw the original
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I ever looked at the later Moldvay/Cook or Mentzer
&lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; lines, other than buying &lt;cite&gt;Isle of Dread&lt;/cite&gt;, thinking like
many that if I was already playing &lt;cite&gt;Advanced D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; that &lt;cite&gt;Basic D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
wouldn't have much to offer. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#basic-dnd" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My younger brother joined the group at some point.  He got &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp;
Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; as a Christmas present one year, from my uncle Chuckie, if I
remember correctly.  We played it several times, but it was a simpler
game than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and at the time seemed to offer less, though in an
entertaining way. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#tnt" id="id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, 1st edition, was probably the first RPG I bought, other
than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.  (How did we buy the &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; books?) We never played
&lt;cite&gt;Gamma World&lt;/cite&gt;, for some reason.  Probably because I wasn't able to
figure out the rules, or because it was too gonzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still in junior high, or perhaps my first year in high school, I
ran across &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.  Although it was written in a “numbered
rules” style that I was unfamiliar with (having never played wargames)
that required me to read it closely several times through before I
understood any of it, I was fascinated by it from the very first read.
&lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;'s skills gave all characters interesting distinguishing
abilities, where as in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; only thieves had similar such abilities
(other classes depending on selection of spells to distinguish the
magic using classes and magic items to distinguish the others.)  The
D100 based unified mechanic used by &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; was also very attractive, as
was the more detailed combat system.  The professional skills seemed
less restrictive and therefore less of a mere game construct than the
equivalent &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; classes.  The fact that every character could learn
magic also seemed freeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the only &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure that I was able to find at the
time was Paul Jaquays' &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; was also a plus, because I
found it to be head and shoulders above any other adventure I had seen
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can seen now that  most of these things I liked about &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; were the
things that added to greater detail in distinguishing characters, as
well as what I called realism them, but today might more accurately
call verisimilitude.  I think a good part of it was that by this time
&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; had become its own genre and I wanted something less tied to
those particular tropes.  &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; seemed to simulate a wider variety of
fantasy than &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is safe to say that I was suffering from an anti-D&amp;amp;D
backlash at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I bought a copy of Avalon Hill's &lt;cite&gt;Powers &amp;amp; Perils&lt;/cite&gt;.  (If
my memory of buying this from the hobby store in downtown Clarksburg
is correct, I must have bought this fairly early on in my gaming
career.)  At some other point I bought Iron Crown's &lt;cite&gt;Rolemaster&lt;/cite&gt;.
Both of these blew my mind with complexity.  &lt;cite&gt;P&amp;amp;P&lt;/cite&gt;'s setting, however,
was another glimpse at a non-&lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; fantasy universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine bought &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; early in our gaming careers.  We
tried making characters a couple of times, but were never able to
figure out what we should do with them afterwards — I think we could
never bridge the gap between dungeon crawling and monsters killing
characters in &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; and 40– and 50– year old ex military characters
in Traveller.  I don't think we had any &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; adventures to
help us along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a very successful &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; campaign in my first year at
college with three of the original group and a couple of other
players, using Paul Jaquays' wonderful &lt;cite&gt;Enchanted Wood&lt;/cite&gt; adventure
setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in college I started a long-running campaign set in SPI's
minimal &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt; setting using &lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; at the
beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My leaning to greater detail and verisimilitude lead me in time to
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, with a small detour along the way for 3rd edition
&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Where did I buy RQ? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, 3rd edition (&lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, the Deluxe Boxed Set) and
&lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt; (also a boxed set) in stores, somewhere.  (I think
this must have been near the time they were released.)  Like
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, I found them fascinating.  Unlike &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; I never got my
group to successfully play &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt;.  The players found &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; character
generation to be too complicated, alas.  &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;
were a glimpse into a style of culture-based gaming that I had never
encountered in my &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; experience, but were complicated enough that
my players hated character generation, and we never got much beyond
that.  I never saw &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the Glorantha materials until much, much
later, post Internet.  &lt;cite&gt;Griffin Island&lt;/cite&gt;, though, even with the
occasional incoherence in its Glorantha-less state, resonated with
more depth than anything I had yet seen.  (I never realized, until
years later, that the Paul Jaquays whose &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; adventure &lt;cite&gt;The Enchanted
Wood&lt;/cite&gt; had so opened my eyes was also one of the authors of &lt;cite&gt;Griffin
Island&lt;/cite&gt;!  I guess at the time I didn't pay much attention to the
authors/designers of games.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; for me was about even more finely grained definition of
characters.  Learning from problems my players had with &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;
character generation, I created &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; versions of all their
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt; characters.  Since, in the process of simulating all
their &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt; abilities with &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, I'd along the way upgraded their
characters somewhat in power, everybody had fun and it all worked out.
Already accustomed to a hex-based tactical combat system and
role-under skills from &lt;cite&gt;DQ&lt;/cite&gt;, it was an easy adjustment to &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, and
the campaign continued successfully for many more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, however, that later I moved away from &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; because
making/updating characters was such a pain, even with the assistance
of Bill Seuer's &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seurer.net/games/utilities/makechar.html"&gt;MAKECHAR&lt;/a&gt; program.  (Let us just say
that the main villain of the campaign, and evil wizard, ended up a
1000 point character, and all the PCs were 300 point characters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosium: &lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Prince
Valiant&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Pendragon&lt;/cite&gt;, Universal Supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran a short &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; campaign after my &lt;cite&gt;Frontiers of Alusia&lt;/cite&gt;
campaign.  This worked better for my players than &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;, as it used
simpler implementation of Chaosium's house system, &lt;cite&gt;BRP&lt;/cite&gt;.  Despite
the brevity of this campaign I have fond memories of &lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-ii-hiatus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part II: Hiatus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that there was a hiatus in my gaming.  I continued to buy and
read RPG material, but didn't have a regular group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this is rambling and desperately needs rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFRP — First encounted in WD?  Then bought main rulebook.  At
first dismissive of the rules, but again fascinated by the picture
of the old world and the high quality of some of the adventures.
The one time I tried running WFRP things didn't work out with
my gaming group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my buying WFRP was during my hiatus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really only came to understand &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; during my hiatus from
gaming, in the 90s, when I started seriously to track down the &lt;cite&gt;RQ3&lt;/cite&gt;
material I'd never know about, including the post RQ3 fanzines.  I
even found a copy of &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt; in a game store in Austin, Texas, while there
on travel for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; found … earlier than &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, later? but only understood much later
in 90s during my serious &lt;cite&gt;RQ&lt;/cite&gt; buying days after I ran a long &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; campaign
(&lt;cite&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/cite&gt;/&lt;cite&gt;Elric&lt;/cite&gt; helped understand/like RQ?) and bought &lt;cite&gt;RQ2&lt;/cite&gt;.
Early GURPS gaming at college BAMF?
Compare to dates of Alusia becoming &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tékumel.  Call of Cthulhu. Jorune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-iii-gaming-again"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part III: Gaming Again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiatus ends.  &lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Bunnies &amp;amp; Burrows&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Buggin&lt;/cite&gt;, Toon,
&lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eric_Holmes"&gt;John Eric Holmes&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Fantasy Role
Playing Games - Dungeons, Dragons and Adventures in Fantasy Gaming&lt;/cite&gt;
(ISBN 0-88254-514-0) at work leads to other gamers, and some
&lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 3.5e and &lt;cite&gt;Star Wars D20&lt;/cite&gt; gaming, and eventually to &lt;cite&gt;Savage
Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my hiatus from gaming, I was looking for simpler games.
&lt;cite&gt;Fudge&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;BESM&lt;/cite&gt;, and finally &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro-gaming: interest in early classic &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules we missed
(which lead to &lt;cite&gt;Wilderlands&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Tegel Manor&lt;/cite&gt; then &lt;cite&gt;Badabaskor&lt;/cite&gt;,
&lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, etc.  then 3e/3.5e reprints) which lead to
buying lots of PDF games including classic &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; module B10 (superb!)
leading to RC purchases, then other &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules and &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; modules,
pondering running &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B20, then buying &lt;cite&gt;Thunder Rift&lt;/cite&gt;, Mystara
interest online maps, retro clones to original D&amp;amp;D interest, buy PDFs
from rpgnow, pondering running &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/cite&gt;, download
retro modules for &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, philotomy, other current &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; player/gm
sites/campaigns/blogs, more JG and understanding which JG were &lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;,
more pondering &lt;cite&gt;BD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for B10 and other B/X modules, and finding the
&lt;cite&gt;OD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Caverns of Thracia&lt;/cite&gt;, by Paul Jaquays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road building costs in JG Ready-Ref sheets!  (PDF just as confusing as
I remember printouts! Did Ray end up with them?) [2019-11-10: I ended
up buying a new copy of the Ready-Ref sheets over the internet several
years later!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parallel thread: tactile pleasures: card, bennies, status chips,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;custom poker chips for wounds, shaken&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  After the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; started to
appear, especially &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt;, I bought the Moldvay/Cook
&lt;cite&gt;Basic/Expert&lt;/cite&gt; rules, and was pleasantly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tnt"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/08/02/gaming-career/#id2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;We completely missing out on the flexibility of the T&amp;amp;T
saving roll system — not surprising, since we never saw any of the
T&amp;amp;T solos that used it so extensively — and how that gave T&amp;amp;T gamist
tactical play without complicated rules, unlike D&amp;amp;D 3e and 3.5e.  I
think we'd have played T&amp;amp;T more if we'd understood that, but I
only really understood after reading some of comments Ron Edwards
made about T&amp;amp;T in 2003, first in the rpg.net thread &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;amp;threadid=46923"&gt;Sell me Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls!&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=858516&amp;amp;postcount=13"&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;), and
then in a series of followup threads at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/"&gt;the Forge&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=6272"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,
