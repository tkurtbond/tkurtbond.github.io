Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4541318/Roman-sling-bullets-deadly-44-Magnum.html?fbclid=IwAR2IZhVYW4-4_BcuQDOq2yGXwwurzBd3HNSo1BzN7XUwZLKHF4XZ54yy0VU"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, headlined “Roman sling bullets
used against Scottish tribes 2,000 years ago were as deadly as a .44
Magnum”, I was thinking about slings in RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often thought that sling bullets are woefully nerfed in many
RPGs, especially D&amp;amp;D.  In D&amp;amp;D 5E, for instance, they're only 1d4,
while a short bow is 1d6 and a long bow is 1d8. For comparison,
daggers are 1d4 and longswords are 1d8.  In OD&amp;amp;D using Greyhawk's
“Damage Done by Weapon Type” table sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; are 1d4, and the
same in B/X D&amp;amp;D's optional “Variable Weapon Damage” table.  AD&amp;amp;D has
sling &lt;em&gt;bullets&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4+1 and sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4.  D&amp;amp;D 3.5E has them
as 1d4.  So the D&amp;amp;D editions pretty consistently have it as
1d4. Definitely nerfed.  Except in 3-book OD&amp;amp;D and B/X D&amp;amp;D without the
“Variable Weapon Damage” table, where all weapons did 1d6 damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; slings are Str+d4, while a bow is 2d6.  For
comparison, a dagger is Str+d4 and a long sword is Str+d8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneQuest"&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt; 2E they are 1d8, similar to a Composite bow at 1d8+1
and broadsword at 1d8.  In Elric! (a member of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer_(role-playing_game)"&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/a&gt; line
of games, appearing between 4th Edition and 5th Edition, but the rules
were substantially equivalent to Stormbringer 5E; It is relative of
RuneQuest mechanically, part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; family
of games) a sling is 1d8+1, similar to a Desert Recurve Bow at 1d8+2,
and a broadsword at 1d8+1.  So in the BRP games they are not nerfed.
In DragonQuest their Damage Modifier is +1, while a dagger is +0, a
long bow is +4 and a broadsword is +4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talislanta"&gt;Talislanta&lt;/a&gt; 4E a sling's Damage Rating is 4, as is a dagger, while a
long bow and broadsword are 8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; 5E, sling damage is 1d6+1, same as a medium bow or a light
long bow, while a medium long bow is 1 ½ d6 (that's 1 and ½ d6)
and a heavy long bow is 2d6.  A dagger is 1d6-1 and a broadsword is
1d6+1.  Note that strong enough characters add damage to this based on
how strong they are. Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS#Prior_RPG_history"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 4E, damage is based on your strength, and the only dice used is
d6.  We'll use an average Strength 10 character as an example.  Their
Thrust damage is 1d-2 and their Swing damage is 1d. An opponent's
Damage Resistance (DR) is subtracted from the rolled damage and any
damage left is multiplied by a modifier for each type of damage.
Piercing damage has a ×1 modifier, cutting has a ×1.5 modifier, and
impaling has a ×2 modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sling damage is swing piercing, and the damage for that for our
average character is 1d.  A longbow is thrust+2 impaling. and the
damage for that is 1d, and whatever makes it past DR is doubled.  A
regular bow is thrust+1 impaling, and the damage for that is 1d+1
(minus DR) ×2.  A dagger is thrust-1 impaling, so that is 1d-3 (minus
DR) ×2.  A thrusting broadsword is swing+1 cutting (1d+1 (minus DR)
×1.5) or thrust+2 impaling (1d+2 (minus DR) ×2).  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that's
nerfed a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'd like to note that when actually playing GURPS I think this is
simpler to do at the table than it sounds like. The damage values for
each attack is figured out at character creation :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasy_Trip"&gt;The Fantasy Trip&lt;/a&gt;, which like GURPS only uses d6, slings do
1d-2, small bows do 1d-1, longbows do 1d+2, daggers do 1d-1, and
broadswords do 2d.  A little bit nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth"&gt;Big Eyes Small Mouth (BESM)&lt;/a&gt; 2nd Edition Revised, slings are not
listed, but a long bow does 5 damage, a longsword does 10 damage, and
a dagger does 5 damage.  In BESM 3rd Edition, an average person has an
Attack Combat Value (ACV) of 4 and a Damage Multiplier of 5.  Each weapon has
a Level, which is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier and added to the
ACV for the final damage.  Slings are Level 1 (1 × 5 + 4 = 9), as are
daggers.  Longbows are Level 3 (3 × 5 + 1 = 16), as are longswords.
Definitely nerfed.  (It is the same in &lt;cite&gt;BESM 4E&lt;/cite&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A2rnMaster"&gt;HarnMaster&lt;/a&gt;, weapon impact (damage) for Melee weapons has three
Aspects, Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A dagger's impact is B
1, E 2, P 5, while a broadsword is B 3, E 5, and P 3.  A Missile
weapon's impact depends on the type of missile weapon and the range:
short, medium, long, and extreme.  Slings are Short 4, Medium 3, Long
2, and Extreme 2.  Shortbows are Short 6, Medium 5, Long 4, Extreme 3.
Longbows are Short 8, Medium 8, Long 6, Extreme 5.  Nerfed.  I'll note
that these weapon or missile impacts are added to a Strike Impact is
decided by a table indexed by how well the attacker did on opposed
rolls of attack skill against the defender's skill in Block,
Counterstrike, Dodge, or if the defender ignored the attack. For Melee
attacks this can result in the defender having blocked the attack,
either the attacker or the defender fumbling or stumbling, the
defender gaining a Tactical Advantage (a free action), or either or
both having made a Strike, which generates from 1 to 4 d6s.  For
Missle attacks this can result in a Miss (with a chance to hit an
adjacent combatant, a Wild (a fumble roll), a Block, or a Strike,
which generates from 1 to 3 d6s.  The Armor Protection value is
subtracked and the result is the total Effective Impact, which is then
referenced on the Injury Table to determine where the on the body the
injury is and how serious it is.  There are no Hit Points like D&amp;amp;D or
Wounds like Savage Worlds.  Instead the character accumulates injuries
like “1 Minor Slash Left Upper Arm, 1 injury level”.  The total injury
level determines the difficulty of the character staying conscious and
penalty to any skill roll.  Some of the injuries may immediately kill
the injured character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good thread by Robert S. Conley (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batintheattic.blogspot.com/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.batintheattic.com/index.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/22847/robert-conley"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpgpub.com/threads/the-one-where-i-sing-the-praises-of-harnmaster.2363/"&gt;RPG PUB&lt;/a&gt;
that talks some more about HarnMaster combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In West End Games' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D6_Fantasy"&gt;D6 Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, attributes are measured in d6s and 2D
is an average human.  Bow and sling damage and melee damage as d6s
added to a number of d6s determined by your Strength Damage, which is
determined by your Physique attribute or Lifting skill (both measured
in d6s), drop any adds, divided by 2.  So our average human's Strength
Damage is 1D.  Then longbows add +2D+2, shortbows add +1D+2, and
slings add +1D.  For comparison, daggers add +1D and broad/long swords
ad +2D+2.  So, nerfed, although it is hard to make precise
distinctions at this level of resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls"&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/a&gt; only uses d6s and weapons are measured in “Dice +
Adds”, that is the number of d6s to roll and the number of points to
add to the dice total.  The common sling is 2d.  A very light self bow
is 2d, a light self bow is 3d, a medium self bow is 4d, a heavy self
bow is 5d, and a extra-heavy self bow is 6d.  These all have
increasing Strength Required to use the weapon.  For comparison, a
Dirk is 2D+1 and a broadsword is 3d+4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warriors"&gt;Dragon Warriors&lt;/a&gt; weapon damage has two parts: an armor
penetration die (measured in dice: d4, d6, d8, etc.) and damage
points.  The armor penetration die is rolled against the Armour Factor
of the defender's armour: a Gambeson has an Armour Factor of 2 while
Plate has an Armor Factor of 5, and the attacker has to roll &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt;
than the Armour Factor to inflict damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sling has Damage (d6, 3 points) while a Bow has Damage (d6, 4
points).  For comparison, a dagger has Damage (d4, 3 points) and a
sword has Damage (d8, 4 points).  Slightly nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I GM games that I think nerf slings, like D&amp;amp;D, I often use a
house rule that sling bullets are higher damage than sling stones, and
more similar to the damage of a short bow, 1d6, for example.  I may
have been underestimating them and should consider them closer to a
long bow, 1d8, as Chaosium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; variants
(RuneQuest, Elric, Stormbringer) do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="addendum"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2020-03-14 Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Classic_Traveller"&gt;Classic Traveller&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Supplement 04 Citizens of the
Imperium&lt;/cite&gt; (1979) has a section on bow weapons, on p. 16!  A sling does
2D wounds and a long bow does 2D wounds also.  For comparison, from
&lt;cite&gt;Book 01 Characters &amp;amp; Combat&lt;/cite&gt; (1981) on p. 47 on the “Range Table” (?)
dagger, blade, cutlass, and sword all do 2D wounds.  Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cepheus Engine&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/237247/Cepheus-Engine-RPG"&gt;C1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.paulelliottbooks.com/what-is-cepheus-engine.html"&gt;C2&lt;/a&gt;) doesn't have slings, but a bow is 2D6.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/304840/The-Sword-of-Cepheus"&gt;Sword of Cepheus&lt;/a&gt;, the fantasy variant, has sling as 2D, short bow
as 2D, long bow as 3D, dagger as 2D, and sword as 3D.  Maybe a little
nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how these adventures differ from current
adventure design.  Both of these adventures present a location with
details about its contents, and give a way that a group of player
characters might get involved.  One of the adventures gives a page
of historical background of the location for the GM, although the
background doesn't directly affect play.  The other gives no history
at all, other than what can be gleaned from observing the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in commercial RPG adventure design has been to deliver
more and more detail for the GM, culminating in the current D&amp;amp;D
adventure format that attempts to provide, on a two-page spread,
absolutely everything that a DM has to have to run a tactical
encounter, from the tactical map to the exact details of each and
every NPC involved, so that the DM doesn't have to look anything up.
Moreover, in many modules, perhaps starting with the &lt;cite&gt;Dragonlance&lt;/cite&gt;
modules in the 1980s, there is a story supplied, which the player
characters are expected, more or less, to follow and figure out, and
some more-or-less obvious goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; certainly don't supply a pre-built story —
any story will be generated by the referee and players at the gaming
table, with possibly some pre-game activity by the referee while
reading the adventure beforehand.  And there are no obvious goals,
just situations to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually find this rather liberating, compared to the more
detailed adventures that are more common today.  There is something
about the things that aren't there in &lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; that
fires up my imagination and draws me into the situation.  It's
probably the same sort of thing that makes me see the original
&lt;cite&gt;Greyhawk&lt;/cite&gt; folio as more interesting that the later &lt;cite&gt;Living Greyhawk
Gazetteer&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention Liz Danforth in the info about the book above because ever
since I ran across her art in 5th edition &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; I've
enjoyed it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the physical design of the Classic Traveller books.  The 8½×5½
stapled booklet is just the right size, physically, to read easily and
carry around, and it opens and lays flat, for easy reference.  As far
as the information content, the physical constraints of the format
provides enough physical space to present a comprehensible amount of
information, without enough the temptation to pad the content with
irrelevancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like visual appearance of these books: the black covers of the
original books — with white text for the book title and subtitle, and red
text and a thick red line for the game title and publisher — were
stark, attractive, and stand out even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gather, from comments from Steve Jackson Games, on the comic-book
sized booklets they printed for the &lt;em&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/em&gt; line in the
early 2000s, that books of these form factors aren't cost effective
for traditional RPG publishers any more.  That's a pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>classic traveller</category><category>design</category><category>econimcs of rpgs</category><category>gaming</category><category>physical</category><category>rpg</category><category>traveller</category><category>visual</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/05/02/classic-traveller-just-the-right-size/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2009 16:30:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recent Reading: Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/04/28/marc-miller-and-game-designers-workshop/</link><dc:creator>T.

“The Olympia Incident” by Martin J. Dougherty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reprint of the 1981 second edition of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, along
with a little bit about the publishing history of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, and a
short story, “The Olympia Incident”, set in the &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;
universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first getting into gaming, I remember going on a trip to
Morgantown, WV with my brother and some of his friends from high
school who were in the gaming group that I'd recently joined.  We
visited a couple of places that sold gaming materials, and one of the
group, R.S. if I remember correctly, bought a copy of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;.  I
remember reading the books in his basement rec room and trying to make
characters.  Unfortunately, at that point the only RPGs that our group
had seen were variants of D&amp;amp;D (T&amp;amp;T and DQ were still a couple years
away), and I, at least, never really figured out &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; and what
you could do with it, and, again if I remember correctly, our group
never did much with &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something must have struck a cord, however, because over the years I
bought several editions of the game, from &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; to
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller: the New Era&lt;/cite&gt; (also known as &lt;cite&gt;T:NE&lt;/cite&gt;), to &lt;cite&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,
to &lt;cite&gt;Marc Miller's Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; (also known as &lt;cite&gt;T4&lt;/cite&gt;), and even including
&lt;cite&gt;2300AD&lt;/cite&gt;, which was originally published as &lt;cite&gt;Traveller: 2300&lt;/cite&gt;, even
though the mechanics and setting were in no way related to the
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; mechanics or setting.  Many of this I probably picked up
during a long period where I wasn't doing any gaming, and just reading
game books. (This would almost certainly have been before the
explosion of RPG stores on the net.)  I probably picked
&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; up after it was out of print; my copy seems to have
the (infamous) errata fixed.  I may have picked up &lt;cite&gt;T:NE&lt;/cite&gt; when it
first came out.  I know I picked up almost all of the &lt;cite&gt;GURPS
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; books as they came out.  I'm sure I picked up &lt;cite&gt;2300AD&lt;/cite&gt; off
the discount rack.  I remember being saddened when GDW closed their
doors, although that was in part due to really enjoying their &lt;cite&gt;Space:
1889&lt;/cite&gt; line and Frank Chadwick's &lt;cite&gt;Cadillacs &amp;amp; Dinosaurs&lt;/cite&gt; RPG, based on
Mark Schultz's comic books, which I had read and enjoyed.  I never got
a chance to play any of GDW's games while they were still in
operation, but have always wanted to play a game with &lt;cite&gt;Space: 1889&lt;/cite&gt;'s
background.  I never figured out what to do with &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,
though. I came closest with &lt;cite&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, having enjoyed playing
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; before my gaming hiatus.  I enjoyed reading all the &lt;cite&gt;GURPS
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; books, but I had no gaming group at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, years later, after I'd gotten back to gaming regularly, in
2007, I had been reading about a number of people who had been playing
Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, which is what folks called the original system,
with or without the Traveller Universe.  They praised the game for its
simplicity and completeness and for its relatively small size.  I had
know about the Far Future Enterprises Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; reprint
line, but couldn't afford them when they first came out.  I did,
however, find a an inexpensive reprint of just Books 1–3, published
jointly by Far Future Enterprises and QuikLink Interactive (also know
as QLI/RPGRealms), and I ordered it in October 2007.  After some
problems with QLI's order system, I finally received my copy in
November, 2007.  It was a reprint of the 1981 2nd edition of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, which apparently cleaned up the rules a little bit.  I
read it quickly, and my reaction was: “Huh.  Why didn't we play the
heck out of this back in high school?  I could see playing this
&lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; and having a blast!”  I liked the basic simplicity of the
system, having moved away from complex systems like &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; to systems
that were much simpler, like &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime later I got Mongoose Publishing's new edition of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,and though it was a reasonable version.  Certainly it was
closest of any system to the original, definitely since
&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, and possibly since the original itself.  And the fact
Mongoose released it with several licenses that allowed free use of
the system, and some use of the background made it more attractive.
It prompted me to go back and read most of my other versions of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, including the FFE/QLI reprint of Books 1–3.  After
looking at them all, it was Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; I wanted to play.  Since
then I've gathered some of the original &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; publications, and
a couple volumes of the FFE reprint volumes.  (I wish they were all
still in print.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have to run a Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; game sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>gaming</category><category>recent reading</category><category>rpg</category><category>science fiction</category><category>traveller</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/04/28/marc-miller-and-game-designers-workshop/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2009 02:41:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
