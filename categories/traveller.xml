&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Double Adventure 1: Shadows &amp;amp; Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt;, by Marc W. Miller;
copyright © 1980 by Game Designers' Workshop; 7th printing;
Product #312.  Art on page 19 by Liz Danforth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how these adventures differ from current
adventure design.  Both of these adventures present a location with
details about its contents, and give a way that a group of player
characters might get involved.  One of the adventures gives a page
of historical background of the location for the GM, although the
background doesn't directly affect play.  The other gives no history
at all, other than what can be gleaned from observing the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in commercial RPG adventure design has been to deliver
more and more detail for the GM, culminating in the current D&amp;amp;D
adventure format that attempts to provide, on a two-page spread,
absolutely everything that a DM has to have to run a tactical
encounter, from the tactical map to the exact details of each and
every NPC involved, so that the DM doesn't have to look anything up.
Moreover, in many modules, perhaps starting with the &lt;cite&gt;Dragonlance&lt;/cite&gt;
modules in the 1980s, there is a story supplied, which the player
characters are expected, more or less, to follow and figure out, and
some more-or-less obvious goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; certainly don't supply a pre-built story —
any story will be generated by the referee and players at the gaming
table, with possibly some pre-game activity by the referee while
reading the adventure beforehand.  And there are no obvious goals,
just situations to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually find this rather liberating, compared to the more
detailed adventures that are more common today.  There is something
about the things that aren't there in &lt;cite&gt;Shadows&lt;/cite&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;cite&gt;Annic Nova&lt;/cite&gt; that
fires up my imagination and draws me into the situation.  It's
probably the same sort of thing that makes me see the original
&lt;cite&gt;Greyhawk&lt;/cite&gt; folio as more interesting that the later &lt;cite&gt;Living Greyhawk
Gazetteer&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention Liz Danforth in the info about the book above because ever
since I ran across her art in 5th edition &lt;cite&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/cite&gt; I've
enjoyed it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the physical design of the Classic Traveller books.  The 8½×5½
stapled booklet is just the right size, physically, to read easily and
carry around, and it opens and lays flat, for easy reference.  As far
as the information content, the physical constraints of the format
provides enough physical space to present a comprehensible amount of
information, without enough the temptation to pad the content with
irrelevancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like visual appearance of these books: the black covers of the
original books — with white text for the book title and subtitle, and red
text and a thick red line for the game title and publisher — were
stark, attractive, and stand out even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gather, from comments from Steve Jackson Games, on the comic-book
sized booklets they printed for the &lt;em&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/em&gt; line in the
early 2000s, that books of these form factors aren't cost effective
for traditional RPG publishers any more.  That's a pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>classic traveller</category><category>design</category><category>econimcs of rpgs</category><category>gaming</category><category>physical</category><category>rpg</category><category>traveller</category><category>visual</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/05/02/classic-traveller-just-the-right-size/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2009 16:30:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recent Reading: Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/04/28/marc-miller-and-game-designers-workshop/</link><dc:creator>T.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, by Marc Miller &amp;amp; Game Designers' Workshop, copyright
1977, 1981 by Game Designer's Workshop.  &lt;cite class="subtitle"&gt;Books 1–3&lt;/cite&gt;,
&lt;cite class="subtitle"&gt;The Basic Books&lt;/cite&gt;, Classic &lt;strong&gt;Traveller&lt;/strong&gt; Reprint Series,
copyright 2001 by Far Future Enterprises; a joint publication of Far
Future Enterprises and QuikLink Interactive, ISBN 1-55878-218-4.
“The Olympia Incident” by Martin J. Dougherty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reprint of the 1981 second edition of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, along
with a little bit about the publishing history of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, and a
short story, “The Olympia Incident”, set in the &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;
universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first getting into gaming, I remember going on a trip to
Morgantown, WV with my brother and some of his friends from high
school who were in the gaming group that I'd recently joined.  We
visited a couple of places that sold gaming materials, and one of the
group, R.S. if I remember correctly, bought a copy of &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;.  I
remember reading the books in his basement rec room and trying to make
characters.  Unfortunately, at that point the only RPGs that our group
had seen were variants of D&amp;amp;D (T&amp;amp;T and DQ were still a couple years
away), and I, at least, never really figured out &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; and what
you could do with it, and, again if I remember correctly, our group
never did much with &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something must have struck a cord, however, because over the years I
bought several editions of the game, from &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; to
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller: the New Era&lt;/cite&gt; (also known as &lt;cite&gt;T:NE&lt;/cite&gt;), to &lt;cite&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,
to &lt;cite&gt;Marc Miller's Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; (also known as &lt;cite&gt;T4&lt;/cite&gt;), and even including
&lt;cite&gt;2300AD&lt;/cite&gt;, which was originally published as &lt;cite&gt;Traveller: 2300&lt;/cite&gt;, even
though the mechanics and setting were in no way related to the
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; mechanics or setting.  Many of this I probably picked up
during a long period where I wasn't doing any gaming, and just reading
game books. (This would almost certainly have been before the
explosion of RPG stores on the net.)  I probably picked
&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; up after it was out of print; my copy seems to have
the (infamous) errata fixed.  I may have picked up &lt;cite&gt;T:NE&lt;/cite&gt; when it
first came out.  I know I picked up almost all of the &lt;cite&gt;GURPS
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; books as they came out.  I'm sure I picked up &lt;cite&gt;2300AD&lt;/cite&gt; off
the discount rack.  I remember being saddened when GDW closed their
doors, although that was in part due to really enjoying their &lt;cite&gt;Space:
1889&lt;/cite&gt; line and Frank Chadwick's &lt;cite&gt;Cadillacs &amp;amp; Dinosaurs&lt;/cite&gt; RPG, based on
Mark Schultz's comic books, which I had read and enjoyed.  I never got
a chance to play any of GDW's games while they were still in
operation, but have always wanted to play a game with &lt;cite&gt;Space: 1889&lt;/cite&gt;'s
background.  I never figured out what to do with &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,
though. I came closest with &lt;cite&gt;GURPS Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, having enjoyed playing
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; before my gaming hiatus.  I enjoyed reading all the &lt;cite&gt;GURPS
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; books, but I had no gaming group at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, years later, after I'd gotten back to gaming regularly, in
2007, I had been reading about a number of people who had been playing
Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, which is what folks called the original system,
with or without the Traveller Universe.  They praised the game for its
simplicity and completeness and for its relatively small size.  I had
know about the Far Future Enterprises Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; reprint
line, but couldn't afford them when they first came out.  I did,
however, find a an inexpensive reprint of just Books 1–3, published
jointly by Far Future Enterprises and QuikLink Interactive (also know
as QLI/RPGRealms), and I ordered it in October 2007.  After some
problems with QLI's order system, I finally received my copy in
November, 2007.  It was a reprint of the 1981 2nd edition of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, which apparently cleaned up the rules a little bit.  I
read it quickly, and my reaction was: “Huh.  Why didn't we play the
heck out of this back in high school?  I could see playing this
&lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; and having a blast!”  I liked the basic simplicity of the
system, having moved away from complex systems like &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; to systems
that were much simpler, like &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime later I got Mongoose Publishing's new edition of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;,and though it was a reasonable version.  Certainly it was
closest of any system to the original, definitely since
&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, and possibly since the original itself.  And the fact
Mongoose released it with several licenses that allowed free use of
the system, and some use of the background made it more attractive.
It prompted me to go back and read most of my other versions of
&lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, including the FFE/QLI reprint of Books 1–3.  After
looking at them all, it was Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; I wanted to play.  Since
then I've gathered some of the original &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; publications, and
a couple volumes of the FFE reprint volumes.  (I wish they were all
still in print.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have to run a Classic &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; game sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>gaming</category><category>recent reading</category><category>rpg</category><category>science fiction</category><category>traveller</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2009/04/28/marc-miller-and-game-designers-workshop/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2009 02:41:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
