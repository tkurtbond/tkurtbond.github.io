&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel, former captain of the Lady Faire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.A. playing Alice Pettigrew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A. playing Captain (Scarred) Jack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.B. playing Phelicity Gujon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recap"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time out the kids had lost their ship, lost the treasure, and
deposed their captain.  They'd had to build themselves a new boat to
escape the once-cursed island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="actual-play"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time out I decided that they'd forced by their dismal economic
situation into working for another pirate delivering smuggled goods,
and ran them through the &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Spanish Main&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/onesheets.html"&gt;one-sheet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/POTSM/Smuggler%27s_Song.pdf"&gt;Smuggler's Song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did pretty well, though they did end up running from the watch
several times.  And they mostly got paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly, my sister was not happy when they told her they'd been
fighting in a bar, so I've promised to steer closer to a “G” rating
next time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>actual-play</category><category>kids</category><category>one-sheet</category><category>peg</category><category>pirates of the spanish main</category><category>rpg</category><category>savage worlds</category><category>spoilers</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/12/20/pirates-session-4-smugglers-song/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2008 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Actual Play: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Part 3</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/11/28/dead-men-tell-no-tales-part-3/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally got to finish the &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Spanish Main&lt;/em&gt; one-sheet
“Dead Men Tell No Tales” that I've been running for the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.A. and L.B. were both here for this one, so the roster was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel, Captain of the Lady Faire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.A. playing Alice Pettigrew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A. playing Scarred Jack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.B. playing Phelicity Gujon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-spoilers"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/POTSM/DeadMen.pdf"&gt;“Dead Men Tell No Tales”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/"&gt;PEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we've had to split the adventure up over three sessions, and
they'd finished the last one the skeletons, and I wanted a big start
to this session, I told the kids their PCs had been arguing about what
to do with the treasure and hanged lady for about an hour.  They spent
a few minutes talking about it, and then I had them make Notice rolls
to avoid being surprised by the skeletons, reanimated after an hour.
They picked up a few wounds in the fight, but managed to finish the
skeletons off.  T.A.'s bad luck with initiative cards and low rolls
continued, though not as badly as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then tried to figure out how they could free themselves of the
curse and the skeletons, and decided the lady needed buried, which
they proceeded to do, right outside the mine entrance.  I had them
make Strength roles to avoid becoming Fatigued, which a couple of the
characters failed.  And that finished out another hour, and a few
minutes later the skeletons attacked again.  M.A. failed Scarred
Jack's Notice roll, so he didn't get dealt in the round, and got hit
by the one of the skeletons.  T.A. forgot to have Isaiah boast the
first round, and ended up owing me a bennie.  Eventually they killed
the skeletons again, and decided, since the curse obviously hadn't
been lifted, that they needed to bury the hanged lady in a cemetery at
the church in town.  Meanwhile, the weather was working up to a storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, they dug the lady up, but in doing so T.A. and L.B. failed enough
Strength rolls to fall unconscious (remember that the curse has been
aging them rapidly), and they knew if they left the unconscious
characters there they would be killed when the skeletons reanimated,
so M.A. and E.A. had Jack and Alice pile the hanged lady's body on
Isaiah and dragged them to the town.  Unfortunately, part way through
digging the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; grave, E.A. failed Alice's Strength roll and fell
unconscious.  Jack was able to get her most of the way out of the
grave, and finished burying the hanged lady with the six skeletons
only 20 yards away &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the zombie pirate captain only 60 yards away.
(Apparently, the zombie pirate captain had been chasing them for days
across the bottom of the sea).  Unfortunately for our heroes, the rest
of the crew, who'd been left on the sloop offshore, picked this moment
to come ashore.  Upon seeing the sorry state of their captain and
officers (and failing their Spirit rolls, they were overcome by greed,
whacked Jack on the head with the shovels, stole the map from their
unconscious captain, and set off for the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCs awoke to a hurricane (which I'd earlier rolled using my
weather die from Flying Buffalo), and found shelter in the church
crypts.  I actually wanted to end the adventure there, but the kids
insisted we continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days the weather finally subsided and they immediately
headed back to the mine to look for the treasure.  It was gone, except
for a bent half-farthing piece that had been overlooked in a crack in
the floor.  At this point they were all suffering from Fatigue from
not eating or drinking for days, and so they went back to the town to
search for water.  When T.A. failed a roll to avoid Fatigue, I ruled
he'd gone delirious, wandered out on the dock, and falling into the
water, to be washed out into the bay.  L.B. had Phelicity swim out to
save him, but by the time she reached him T.A. had failed his swimming
roll and was drowning.  Phelicity swam down and brought him to the
surface and back to shore, but he had died.  Luckily, M.A. tried to
resuscitate, and failing the first roll spent a bennie (the last
bennie among the group) to reroll, and aced well enough to overcome
the –4 penalty from drowning and the –2 penalty from being untrained
in Healing, and saved Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I pointed out Isaiah's consistent bad luck, loosing the
treasure, loosing his ship, and Jack's comparative good luck, and like
proper little pirates they voted Isaiah out as captain and Jack in.
After that Jack climbed some palm trees and found some weird fruit so
they could eat.  I decided that the island had &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; living creatures
at all, due to the curse, but that they could find enough edible
plants so they wouldn't starve for the weeks it would take while they
built a small boat (with both oars &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a sail) from timber scavenged
from the houses in the village to take them off the island to begin
their search for their traitorous crew and their treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's were we left them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this actually ran pretty long, once all sessions were
considered, I gave them all 5 XP.  Not wanting T.A. to be too
discouraged, I let him trade his “Captain” edge in for something else.
I didn't let him buy off his “Cocky” Hindrance, though. &lt;img alt="(:-)" src="https://tkurtbond.github.io/images/smiley-small.png" style="height: 0.75em;"&gt;
Judging by everybody's reactions, I've got a &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Spanish
Main&lt;/em&gt; campaign to run now.  I can already see how to work the
“Smuggler's Song” one-sheet in as the next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add Wound Penalties to Fatigue Penalties and things really start
getting grim fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="introduction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my notes for this session aren't very good.  I'm not
&lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; sure if everybody who played the previous session was here
to finishing the adventure off in this session, but I think so,
because L.B. was here and all the pre-generated characters for this
one-sheet were in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attending"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A. played Gar IronHelm;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.A. played Merula Lanus;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;B.B. played Marcus Two Hands (when he wasn't helping out with baby C.A.);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.B. played Ramel Ramelson; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.A. played Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.B. played Serena, Aevakar Priestess (from the &lt;em&gt;Shaintar: Immortal
Legends&lt;/em&gt; free download &lt;em&gt;Heroic Archetypes&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="l-b-joins-the-group-with-a-shiny-new-character"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;L.B. joins the group with a shiny new character&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.B. was here, and wanted to play, of course.  Since all the pregens
were in use, I pulled out the characters from the &lt;em&gt;Shaintar: Immortal
Legends&lt;/em&gt; free download &lt;em&gt;Heroic Archetypes&lt;/em&gt; and had her look through
and see if she liked anything.  She found Serena, the Aevakar
Priestess, and fell in love.  (L.B: “Look!  An &lt;em&gt;Angel!&lt;/em&gt;” T.K.B.:
“Well, not an angel, but she is magical and can fly…” L.B. “Cool!”)  I
swapped out a few &lt;em&gt;Shaintar&lt;/em&gt;-specific items and adjusted her XP up to
match the “Tomb of Terror” pregens, and we got down to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="actual-play"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, my notes for this game were…not good, so I don't have
much to report.  I do remember that they tried to burn the obviously
magical journal of the insane necromancer, which put out a poison
cloud that forced them to evacuate the village, and L.B.'s character
Serena got to fly above the evacuees and make sure they were headed
away from the poison cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt; seemed to
have fun, and L.B. really wanted to play with her character again, so
we might come back to these characters at some point.  Certainly I
have my doubts as to whether the journal could be destroyed by a
simple fire…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>actual-play</category><category>fantasy</category><category>kids</category><category>one-sheet</category><category>rpg</category><category>savage worlds</category><category>spoilers</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/11/28/tomb-of-terror-part-2/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2008 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Actual Play: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Part 2</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2008/11/25/dead-men-tell-no-tales-part-2/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran another session using the the &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Spanish Main&lt;/em&gt;
one-sheet “Dead Men Tell No Tales” with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-spoilers"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/POTSM/DeadMen.pdf"&gt;“Dead Men Tell No Tales”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/"&gt;PEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.A. couldn't attend, but L.B. could, so she played Phillipe Gujon and
Alice Pettigrew, and out of deference to her dislike of playing
“boys”, it was revealed that “Phillipe” was actually “Phelicity”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the roster was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel, Captain of the Lady Faire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A. playing Scarred Jack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.B. playing (as her main character) Phelicity Gujon and (as her
secondary character) Alice Pettigrew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked up a couple of days from the island on the map.  Not liking
the look of the decayed dock, they anchored offshore and left the crew
to guard the sloop.  On shore they found everybody 50 years dead.
They easily found the mine, ignored the skeletons wrapped in pirate
flags, and were shocked to find the lady hanging above the treasure in
the depths of the mines.  And of course, they were then attacked by
the six skeletons wrapped in pirate flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T.A. was plagued by poor initiative card draws and low rolls, and
earned the unhappy nickname “Captain Slowpants”, and eventually ended
up “Captain Slow-anything”, much to his dismay.  Eventually, however,
they managed to kill the skeletons, and that's where the game ended.
(We only had a short time to play.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played in my living room around a low, 2 foot diameter table,
keeping dice, tokens, and cards on the table and character sheets
off.  We didn't bother to user miniatures.  I used gaming stones to
represent wound and shaken statuses, and check track of the skeletons
just by removing the d6 that I rolled for their fighting attacks, so
there was no book keeping.  I thought that all worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My bones and joints, on the other hand, did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work well when
getting up off the floor after a couple of hours of play.)&lt;/p&gt;

the Spanish Main&lt;/em&gt; Savage Worlds one-sheet “Dead Men Tell No Tales”
this afternoon and evening, before and after supper.  This is one of
the free downloads &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/"&gt;Pinnacle Entertainment Group&lt;/a&gt; did for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roster was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.A. playing Isaiah Kestrel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.A. playing Alice Pettigrew and Phillipe Gujon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A. played Scarred Jack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-spoilers"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/POTSM/DeadMen.pdf"&gt;“Dead Men Tell No Tales”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/"&gt;PEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the dying pirate with the chest manacled to his foot, and
after he died opened the chest and found the treasure map, and decided
to head for the island.  Along the way they found and boarded the
decaying pirate ship, from which they deduced had come the dying
pirate.  They had a hard time with the zombie pirate captain wildcard,
who had the luck of the initiative most of the time, ending up with
the Joker &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; times, and the high card of the draw most of the
rest of the time.  The zombie wildcard incapacitated Alice with one
blow that ended up doing five wounds at a whack, and things were
looking dire.  However, the zombie pirate captain's luck with the
iniative cards finally left him However, E.A., rolling for the crew
extras who showed up after hearing Alice scream as she went down, aced
an attack roll, then aced all three of the damage dice, and then aced
at least one of the rerolls, putting the wildcard down decisively.
After that M.A. had Scarred Jack try an untrained Healing roll and
aced it big time, so most of Alice's wounds got healed and M.A. wants
Jack to learn Healing for real now, which is neat.  After they
returned to their ship the other ship collapsed and sank.  They
decided to continue to follow the treasure map, even though a storm
came up.  Alice was unconscious for four days.  After couple of days
it was obvious that they and their ship were suffering from the curse,
and that's were we had to leave the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have looked up all the details of the edges and hindrances
and wrote them on the kids character sheets, and on my copies, before
the kids came over for the game.  I had to do it while they were
there, and of course they wanted to get on to the gaming.  However, I
knew we'd be looking them up in the middle of game if I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to play more often so I can keep the details in mind
better.  Maybe next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got through the first encounter with very little difficulty,
largely because I forgot the very important surprise packages the
zombies had that should have gone off when they died, and then nearly
had a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#TPK"&gt;TPK&lt;/a&gt; when I set them all off at once.  They got to where they
could hear the next encounter when we had to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can finish this at Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="savage-worlds"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I ran &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/SWEX/Eternal%20Nazi.pdf"&gt;“The Eternal Nazi”&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games-played-with-the-kids/#savage-worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; pulp one-sheet
for them.  Like many of the one-sheets, it didn't come with a map, so
I made one a couple of nights before using printable PDF tiles.  The
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt; had fun, but I can see why Kator the Ape Boy wasn't in the most
recent pregenerated pulp characters download intended for use with
“The Eternal Nazi”: as the sole melee-only character he was at a serious
disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this was actually the first time I've used modern weapons in
Savage Worlds.  It went ok, although I did forget each shot on
auto-fire counts as three bullets expended.  I think I'll add some
grenades to the PCs gear the next time I run it, suggest the PCs other
than Buck pick up some of the germain submachine guns, and up the
number of extras with the big bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- and make sure to set up a situation with strafing? --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div class="section" id="reflections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying out some new technology (for me): using printable
PDF tiles from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.skeletonkeygames.com/"&gt;Skeleton Key Games&lt;/a&gt; (SKG) for the battle mats.  I
especially like the SKG tiles for a couple of reasons.  First, the
tile graphics in the PDF files can be easily extracted (just
right-click and choose copy) and munged to produce custom tiles.
Secondly, the tile sets include thumbnail catalogs of the tiles, which
can easily be extracted and added to the tilesets of programs like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dungeonmapping.com/df/public_html/"&gt;DungeonForge&lt;/a&gt;.  This makes it a lot easier to design the map layouts
to begin with (virtual tile flipping replaces physical tile flipping)
and makes it easy to produce small scale maps for reference for laying
out the tiles on the table by exporting the maps from DungeonForge as
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.PNG&lt;/code&gt; files and adding labels with the tile numbers with the GIMP.
(This is especially useful when using wilderness tiles!)  On the
printed tiles I wrote the tile number on the back, again to make
things easier when laying them out on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the tiles worked pretty well.  The worst problem was that the
tiles tended to curve up at the edges, a common problem with cardstock
printed on inkjet printers: as the large surface area of ink dries the
edges curl up.  This didn't prevent their use, and curling them in the
opposite direction before laying them out helped, but I think I'll try
laminating them and see if that helps.  My first map designs using the
tiles were not as interesting as I wanted, but the tiles themselves
looked good and worked pretty well.  The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/"&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt; occasionally dislodged
the tiles a little, but that was easily fixed, and once while dealing
initiative cards I accidently slide one under the tiles, which got a
laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we played I redesigned the maps to give a more dynamic
environment, since I'm planning on running “The Eternal Nazi” for
another other gaming group.  I got a couple more of the SKG sets, and
used GIMP to make three custom tiles.  This let me make a much more
interesting environment.  Part of the problem I had with designing the
map in the first place was inexperience with the tiles, but part was
because the tile sets I had were heavily slanted towards fantasy, and
I was constructing something more out of the “lost race” pulp
adventure stories, set in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I'd like to see is a bunch of tiles with items that
could be dropped on top of other tiles, like piles of metal barrels
and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dungeonmapping.com/df/public_html/"&gt;DungeonForge&lt;/a&gt; has a couple of annoying bugs, but it's free and works
well enough, as long as I remember to save often and not put tiles
against the edges of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todo: I'll try to edit more actual play details into this post when I've got a
moment and my notes are handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
