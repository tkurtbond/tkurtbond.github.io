Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran across an interesting article: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107143330/http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com:80/2012/02/d-next-zones-of-control-from-chainmail.html"&gt;D&amp;amp;D Next: "Zones of Control"
from Chainmail to 4e&lt;/a&gt; which argues, I think with good evidence, that
every version of &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has been based in miniatures as its default
mode of play.  (Alas the original site of this article, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com"&gt;Advanced
Dungeons &amp;amp; Parenting&lt;/a&gt; appears to having fallen to some annoying
entropy creating demons.  Some poking about seems to show the original
author being Christian Lindke of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.geekeratimedia.com/"&gt;Geekerati&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split between abstract combat and miniatures combat was well
established by the time I started with &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, reading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1977_version"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/every-edition-of-dd-has-specified-some-things-in-terms-of-miniatures/#holmes" id="id4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; edition and then playing first edition &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;.  We never
played with miniatures.  Indeed, I think the hex grid and miniatures
based tactical combat rules were one of the things that drew me to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

added the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1977_version"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt; edition, the 1977 blue box Basic Set,

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/turning-dd-character-deaths-into-deal-that-benefits-game-and-story/"&gt;Turning Character Deaths in D&amp;amp;D Into Deals that
Benefit Game and Story&lt;/a&gt;, David Hartlage (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/"&gt;DM David&lt;/a&gt;) points out an
interesting quote from Gary Gygax in the &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; on Character Death.  (The
whole post is worth reading, as are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/start-here-my-most-popular-and-favorite-posts/"&gt;many of his others&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went looking for the quote so I could give a more complete reference
for it.  (PDF versions of old gaming books are wonderful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first edition &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master%27s_Guide#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;Dungeon Master's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, on p. 110, in the
section “Conducting the Game”, subsection “Rolling the Dice and
Control of the Game”, Gary Gygax wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then a player will die through no fault of his own. He or
she will have done everything correctly, taken every reasonable
precaution, but still the freakish roll of the dice will kill the
character. In the long run you should let such things pass as the
players will kill more than one opponent with their own freakish
rolls at some later time. Yet you do have the right to arbitrate
the situation. You can rule that the player, instead of dying, is
knocked unconscious, loses a limb, is blinded in one eye or invoke
any reasonably severe penalty that still takes into account what
the monster has done. It is very demoralizing to the players to
lose a cared-for-player character when they have played well. When
they have done something stupid or have not taken precautions,
then let the dice fall where they may!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, every time I read the original &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at
everything that Gygax managed to fit into that book.  Of course, when
I read the three booklets of original &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at what he
managed to fit in those as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>1e</category><category>ad&amp;d</category><category>d&amp;d</category><category>gygax</category><category>od&amp;d</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/gygax-on-character-death/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 18:27:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Slings in RPGs: Often Nerfed</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/07/slings-in-rpgs-often-nerfed/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4541318/Roman-sling-bullets-deadly-44-Magnum.html?fbclid=IwAR2IZhVYW4-4_BcuQDOq2yGXwwurzBd3HNSo1BzN7XUwZLKHF4XZ54yy0VU"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, headlined “Roman sling bullets
used against Scottish tribes 2,000 years ago were as deadly as a .44
Magnum”, I was thinking about slings in RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often thought that sling bullets are woefully nerfed in many
RPGs, especially D&amp;amp;D.  In D&amp;amp;D 5E, for instance, they're only 1d4,
while a short bow is 1d6 and a long bow is 1d8. For comparison,
daggers are 1d4 and longswords are 1d8.  In OD&amp;amp;D using Greyhawk's
“Damage Done by Weapon Type” table sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; are 1d4, and the
same in B/X D&amp;amp;D's optional “Variable Weapon Damage” table.  AD&amp;amp;D has
sling &lt;em&gt;bullets&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4+1 and sling &lt;em&gt;stones&lt;/em&gt; as 1d4.  D&amp;amp;D 3.5E has them
as 1d4.  So the D&amp;amp;D editions pretty consistently have it as
1d4. Definitely nerfed.  Except in 3-book OD&amp;amp;D and B/X D&amp;amp;D without the
“Variable Weapon Damage” table, where all weapons did 1d6 damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; slings are Str+d4, while a bow is 2d6.  For
comparison, a dagger is Str+d4 and a long sword is Str+d8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneQuest"&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt; 2E they are 1d8, similar to a Composite bow at 1d8+1
and broadsword at 1d8.  In Elric! (a member of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormbringer_(role-playing_game)"&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/a&gt; line
of games, appearing between 4th Edition and 5th Edition, but the rules
were substantially equivalent to Stormbringer 5E; It is relative of
RuneQuest mechanically, part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; family
of games) a sling is 1d8+1, similar to a Desert Recurve Bow at 1d8+2,
and a broadsword at 1d8+1.  So in the BRP games they are not nerfed.
In DragonQuest their Damage Modifier is +1, while a dagger is +0, a
long bow is +4 and a broadsword is +4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talislanta"&gt;Talislanta&lt;/a&gt; 4E a sling's Damage Rating is 4, as is a dagger, while a
long bow and broadsword are 8.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; 5E, sling damage is 1d6+1, same as a medium bow or a light
long bow, while a medium long bow is 1 ½ d6 (that's 1 and ½ d6)
and a heavy long bow is 2d6.  A dagger is 1d6-1 and a broadsword is
1d6+1.  Note that strong enough characters add damage to this based on
how strong they are. Not nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS#Prior_RPG_history"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 4E, damage is based on your strength, and the only dice used is
d6.  We'll use an average Strength 10 character as an example.  Their
Thrust damage is 1d-2 and their Swing damage is 1d. An opponent's
Damage Resistance (DR) is subtracted from the rolled damage and any
damage left is multiplied by a modifier for each type of damage.
Piercing damage has a ×1 modifier, cutting has a ×1.5 modifier, and
impaling has a ×2 modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sling damage is swing piercing, and the damage for that for our
average character is 1d.  A longbow is thrust+2 impaling. and the
damage for that is 1d, and whatever makes it past DR is doubled.  A
regular bow is thrust+1 impaling, and the damage for that is 1d+1
(minus DR) ×2.  A dagger is thrust-1 impaling, so that is 1d-3 (minus
DR) ×2.  A thrusting broadsword is swing+1 cutting (1d+1 (minus DR)
×1.5) or thrust+2 impaling (1d+2 (minus DR) ×2).  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that's
nerfed a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'd like to note that when actually playing GURPS I think this is
simpler to do at the table than it sounds like. The damage values for
each attack is figured out at character creation :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantasy_Trip"&gt;The Fantasy Trip&lt;/a&gt;, which like GURPS only uses d6, slings do
1d-2, small bows do 1d-1, longbows do 1d+2, daggers do 1d-1, and
broadswords do 2d.  A little bit nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes,_Small_Mouth"&gt;Big Eyes Small Mouth (BESM)&lt;/a&gt; 2nd Edition Revised, slings are not
listed, but a long bow does 5 damage, a longsword does 10 damage, and
a dagger does 5 damage.  In BESM 3rd Edition, an average person has an
Attack Combat Value (ACV) of 4 and a Damage Multiplier of 5.  Each weapon has
a Level, which is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier and added to the
ACV for the final damage.  Slings are Level 1 (1 × 5 + 4 = 9), as are
daggers.  Longbows are Level 3 (3 × 5 + 1 = 16), as are longswords.
Definitely nerfed.  (It is the same in &lt;cite&gt;BESM 4E&lt;/cite&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A2rnMaster"&gt;HarnMaster&lt;/a&gt;, weapon impact (damage) for Melee weapons has three
Aspects, Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A dagger's impact is B
1, E 2, P 5, while a broadsword is B 3, E 5, and P 3.  A Missile
weapon's impact depends on the type of missile weapon and the range:
short, medium, long, and extreme.  Slings are Short 4, Medium 3, Long
2, and Extreme 2.  Shortbows are Short 6, Medium 5, Long 4, Extreme 3.
Longbows are Short 8, Medium 8, Long 6, Extreme 5.  Nerfed.  I'll note
that these weapon or missile impacts are added to a Strike Impact is
decided by a table indexed by how well the attacker did on opposed
rolls of attack skill against the defender's skill in Block,
Counterstrike, Dodge, or if the defender ignored the attack. For Melee
attacks this can result in the defender having blocked the attack,
either the attacker or the defender fumbling or stumbling, the
defender gaining a Tactical Advantage (a free action), or either or
both having made a Strike, which generates from 1 to 4 d6s.  For
Missle attacks this can result in a Miss (with a chance to hit an
adjacent combatant, a Wild (a fumble roll), a Block, or a Strike,
which generates from 1 to 3 d6s.  The Armor Protection value is
subtracked and the result is the total Effective Impact, which is then
referenced on the Injury Table to determine where the on the body the
injury is and how serious it is.  There are no Hit Points like D&amp;amp;D or
Wounds like Savage Worlds.  Instead the character accumulates injuries
like “1 Minor Slash Left Upper Arm, 1 injury level”.  The total injury
level determines the difficulty of the character staying conscious and
penalty to any skill roll.  Some of the injuries may immediately kill
the injured character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good thread by Robert S. Conley (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batintheattic.blogspot.com/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.batintheattic.com/index.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/22847/robert-conley"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpgpub.com/threads/the-one-where-i-sing-the-praises-of-harnmaster.2363/"&gt;RPG PUB&lt;/a&gt;
that talks some more about HarnMaster combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In West End Games' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D6_Fantasy"&gt;D6 Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, attributes are measured in d6s and 2D
is an average human.  Bow and sling damage and melee damage as d6s
added to a number of d6s determined by your Strength Damage, which is
determined by your Physique attribute or Lifting skill (both measured
in d6s), drop any adds, divided by 2.  So our average human's Strength
Damage is 1D.  Then longbows add +2D+2, shortbows add +1D+2, and
slings add +1D.  For comparison, daggers add +1D and broad/long swords
ad +2D+2.  So, nerfed, although it is hard to make precise
distinctions at this level of resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_%26_Trolls"&gt;Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls&lt;/a&gt; only uses d6s and weapons are measured in “Dice +
Adds”, that is the number of d6s to roll and the number of points to
add to the dice total.  The common sling is 2d.  A very light self bow
is 2d, a light self bow is 3d, a medium self bow is 4d, a heavy self
bow is 5d, and a extra-heavy self bow is 6d.  These all have
increasing Strength Required to use the weapon.  For comparison, a
Dirk is 2D+1 and a broadsword is 3d+4.  Nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warriors"&gt;Dragon Warriors&lt;/a&gt; weapon damage has two parts: an armor
penetration die (measured in dice: d4, d6, d8, etc.) and damage
points.  The armor penetration die is rolled against the Armour Factor
of the defender's armour: a Gambeson has an Armour Factor of 2 while
Plate has an Armor Factor of 5, and the attacker has to roll &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt;
than the Armour Factor to inflict damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sling has Damage (d6, 3 points) while a Bow has Damage (d6, 4
points).  For comparison, a dagger has Damage (d4, 3 points) and a
sword has Damage (d8, 4 points).  Slightly nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I GM games that I think nerf slings, like D&amp;amp;D, I often use a
house rule that sling bullets are higher damage than sling stones, and
more similar to the damage of a short bow, 1d6, for example.  I may
have been underestimating them and should consider them closer to a
long bow, 1d8, as Chaosium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing"&gt;Basic Roleplaying (BRP)&lt;/a&gt; variants
(RuneQuest, Elric) do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>d&amp;d</category><category>dragonquest</category><category>rpg</category><category>runequest</category><category>slings</category><category>talislanta</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/07/slings-in-rpgs-often-nerfed/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 19:40:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Delving Deeper Revisited</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2015/12/14/delving-deeper-revisited/</link><dc:creator>T.

few weeks ago, and it prompted me to reread it in some depth.  (It had
been some time since I read my copy of the Delving Deeper &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2013/03/21/my-delving-deeper-boxset-came-today/"&gt;box
set&lt;/a&gt;.)  The current version of the Delving Deeper Reference Rules
(V4) is available &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; in hypertext or for free download as three
digest-sized booklets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided I like this rule set very much.  It really seems to
reflect the rules of the original 3 Little Brown Books of Original D&amp;amp;D
very well, and I can see that there are enough differences from, say,
the Labyrinth Lord rules that I have been using, to make it a
different experience.  I'm looking forward to trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It prompted me to sit down and draw out a dungeon level and fill it
using the method in &lt;cite&gt;Delving Deeper&lt;/cite&gt;, which turned out to be good fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>0e</category><category>d&amp;d</category><category>delving deeper</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2015/12/14/delving-deeper-revisited/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 19:09:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>“Footsteps of the Fallen” comes to an end</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2014/11/11/footsteps-of-the-fallen-comes-to-an-end/</link><dc:creator>T.

&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played the last session of M.A.H.'s “Footsteps of the Fallen”
campaign, and were successful in eliminating the Mourning!  In mass
battle we defeated the army of the Lord of the Blades.  Afterward we
killed the Lord of the Blades, but the psychic purple creature who
turned out to be behind it all escaped.  We're left with a bunch of
psychically active purple glass that can be mined and turned into
psychically active artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably the 33rd game session we'd played, and we'd been
playing since the first session on 2013-02-27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Avarey&lt;/strong&gt;, a male Half-Elf Cleric. (light green lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Sallee Marie&lt;/strong&gt;, a female Halfing Fighter. (light blue lego
base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Gustavio&lt;/strong&gt;, a male Gnome Magic User.  HP 4,
AC 5. (green lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt;, a male Dwarf.  HP 4, AC 6.  (yellow lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T.K.B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt;, a human Cleric of Thor.  HP 5, AC 3. (red lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Skeggi&lt;/strong&gt;, a human Cleric of Vidar.  HP 6, AC 4 (3 with
shield). (blue lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Semiriah&lt;/strong&gt;, an Elf Ranger.  HP 3, AC 5 (4 with shield). (sparkly
pink lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Maury&lt;/strong&gt;, a human Thief.  HP 5, AC 6. (tan lego base)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="house-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong class="rule"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/strong&gt; happens on a natural twenty on an attack roll,
and damage is doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;strong&gt;isn't&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong class="rule"&gt;Critical Misses&lt;/strong&gt; rule, but sometimes on a
natural one on an attack roll something embarrassing and
funny but usually non-damaging happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="actual-play"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt; puts on Ring.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt; takes it off.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt; puts it
back on.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt; scratches him, but the scratch doesn't heal instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went back to 3rd level of the dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Maury&lt;/strong&gt; successfully opens a lock!  (For the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time in
this dungeon, we think.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Adventurer corpses, one dressed as a magic user: 120 gp, 400 ep,
scroll.  Nothing else worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found room with pool of clear water, with a figure chained at the
bottom, struggling.  Can't reach it with a 10 foot pole.  Can't pull
it up with rope and grappling hook.  Men see it as a beautiful woman
and the women see it as a handsome man, while &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Avarey&lt;/strong&gt; sees it as
a beautiful elven princess.  Tied a rope to &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Maury&lt;/strong&gt; and sent her
down to pick lock.  Takes a couple of tries.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Maury&lt;/strong&gt; puts other
rope noose around the figure.  She sees the figure wither into a
skeleton.  We pull them both up.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Maury&lt;/strong&gt; gets the boots and pouch
off the skeleton, which convinces &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt; that it's not as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pouch contains thieves tools, 157 gp, 45 sp, and 2 gems, worth
150 sp each. There is a rusty longsword.  &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt; smashes the sword
against the wall.  It breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt; touches the figure, and sees it wither into a skeleton.  He
bashes the bones into pieces, then wipes the bone dust from his mace.
The others see &lt;strong class="pc"&gt;Orm&lt;/strong&gt; bash the beautiful man/woman into pieces,
then wipe the blood from his mace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="aftermath"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay 3 gp each to the hirelings, 18 gp total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total gold from last time and this: 6031.5 gp, so 753.93 gp each.
Total XP from last time and this: &lt;strong&gt;+816 XP&lt;/strong&gt; each!  With a 5% XP
bonus that is &lt;strong&gt;+856 XP&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ends &lt;cite&gt;The Idol of the Orcs&lt;/cite&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger arrives with letter for us.  From Mortimer Bean, scribe of
the Library of Tobin.  Commends us for driving out orcs.  Offers us a
job retrieving the &lt;cite&gt;Hyperion Cantos&lt;/cite&gt; from the estate of &lt;strong class="npc"&gt;Tazimack
the Red&lt;/strong&gt;, which had been checked out from the Library years before by
&lt;strong class="npc"&gt;Tazimack the Red&lt;/strong&gt;, who has since died at his estate in in the
village of Tolb.  They'll pay us 1000 gp.&lt;/p&gt;
