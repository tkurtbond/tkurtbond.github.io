&lt;p&gt;I finished reading the &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome&lt;/cite&gt; from cover to cover and I am very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say in my terse Goodreads review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576056628l/49203328._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49203328-old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy"&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy: Rules Tome&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16187767.Gavin_Norman"&gt;Gavin Norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D (B/X D&amp;amp;D) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13454227-t-kurt"&gt;View all my reviews on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/roleplaying-games/#how-i-got-started"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; that I started playing with first edition AD&amp;amp;D.
As far as I can remember, we often simplified things: I don't remember
using segments, spell components, weapon speed factors, or armor class
adjustments, and I'm not sure we used anything like the actual
official combat sequence.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#addict" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;I never picked up the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert Sets, unfortunately, since I foolishly
thought “Advanced” meant better than “Basic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; is an wonderful way
for someone to learn the rules of classic D&amp;amp;D, and for running classic
D&amp;amp;D campaigns.  I wish it had been around when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.
I'd recommend it today for anyone learning to play, or anyone who
prefers the classic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- See DMG p. 61, “Encounters, Combat, and Initiative”. --&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="addict"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2021/09/06/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules on Initiative on p. 62–63 of the Dungeon Master's Guide
(DMG) sound simple, but there are further elaborations elsewhere in
the DMG (“Simultaneous Initiative” on p. 66, for instance) and
other AD&amp;amp;D 1E rule books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a 20 page document, &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons®
Initiative and Combat Table&lt;/cite&gt;, compiled by David M. Prata, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://idiscepolidellamanticora.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/addict.pdf"&gt;I1&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://knights-n-knaves.com/dmprata/ADDICT.pdf"&gt;I2&lt;/a&gt;) to come anywhere near compiling and explaining the actual
first edition AD&amp;amp;D initiative and combat sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely convinced that there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a completely
consistent interpretation of the rules, but people have spent a lot
of time and effort trying to figure one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's a brief but clear discussion of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Initiative
Controversy&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706181418/http://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=15891"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; on archive.org) describing both The
A.D.D.I.C.T. Method and the OSRIC method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the Dungeon Master rules (creating and running adventures; monsters; encounters, treasures, and magic items) of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is common with the other Old-School Essentials titles, this is very well organized and presented. It is interesting what was integrated from first edition AD&amp;amp;D and what was left out. (For instance, there is a Wand of Summoning, but no Summon Monster spells.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic Dungeon Master rules. I wish something this clear had been available when I started playing D&amp;amp;D.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; would probably be my first
choice for any new D&amp;amp;D campaign I start, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4056920456"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This adapts the classes, races, spells, and other player facing rules of first edition AD&amp;amp;D to the scale and mechanics of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh edition of Basic/Expert D&amp;amp;D, contrasting with Labyrinth Lord: Revised, Advanced Edition Companion, and Advanced Labyrinth Lord, which does it the other way around and adapts the B/X rules to the scale of first edition AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must admit I miss the monk, and the two Hit Dice at first level of the Ranger from AD&amp;amp;D 1E, but I suppose the former is out because of the common perception that it doesn't thematically fit the pseudo-medieval setting of most D&amp;amp;D games, and the latter is part of adapting to the scale of B/X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome is another excellent presentation of the classic rules in a well designed and sturdy hard back book. I'm impressed with the organization and clarity of the presentation. I think that this is an excellent choice for someone new to D&amp;amp;D to learn the classic player rules.

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple improvement on B/X D&amp;amp;D and OD&amp;amp;D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I've wished
that the B/X and OD&amp;amp;D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions, like that of AD&amp;amp;D.  As it
is, you have to read the spell description to figure out if a saving
throw is allowed and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Basic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Classic Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Advanced Fantasy&lt;/cite&gt;;
&lt;cite&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Core&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Whitebox&lt;/cite&gt;; and &lt;cite&gt;Delving
Deeper&lt;/cite&gt;, all fail to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; surprised that &lt;cite&gt;Old-School Essentials&lt;/cite&gt; didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This was originally on my site as a static page, but those don't get
added the tags page, so I moved it here as a post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master%27s_Guide"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide&lt;/a&gt; (1979), by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="appendix-n-inspirational-and-educational-reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX N: INSPIRATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL READING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiration for all of the fantasy work I have done stems directly
from the love my father showed when I was a tad, for he spent many
hours telling me stories he made up as he went along, tales of cloaked
old me who could grant wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords, or
wicked sorcerors and dauntless swordsmen.  Then too, countless
Hundreds of comic books went down, and the long-gone EC ones certainly
had their effect.  Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies were a
big influence.  In fact, all of us tend to get ample helpings of
fantasy when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those written
by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.  This often leads to reading
books of mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation of
compilations of the myths of various lands and peoples.  Upon such a
base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all
science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950.  The following
authors were of particular inspiration to me.  In some cases I cite
specific works, in others, I simply recommand all their fantasy
writing to you.  From such sources, as well as just about any other
imaginative writing or screenplay you will be able to pluck kernels
from which grow the fruits of exciting campaigns.  Good reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspirational Reading:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelazny, Roger.  JACK OF SHADOWS; “Amber” Series; et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate influences upon AD&amp;amp;D were probably de Camp &amp;amp; Pratt,
REH, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, HPL, and A. Merrit; but all of the
above authors, as well as many not listed, certainly helped to shape
the form of the game.  For this reason, and for the hours of reading
enjoyment, I heartily recommend the works of these fine authors to
you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RuneQuest 2E also had an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2013/11/20/runequest-appendix-n/"&gt;Appendix N&lt;/a&gt;, apparently earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once quoted Ken Hite's description of D&amp;amp;D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original D&amp;amp;D seems, quite obviously, to be a pastiche of Fritz
Leiber and Robert E. Howard adventure stories, set in a Tolkeinian
world of Moorcockian morality, using Jack Vance's magic system,
redacted for multiple protagonists. No wonder things are confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to a friend, and they were a little offended, considering it a
criticism of D&amp;amp;D.  I guess it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a criticism, but I think it is a
valid description of D&amp;amp;D.  However, I advance the theory that this
“confused” nature of D&amp;amp;D is what makes it successful, because it
provides so many different (and sometimes conflicting) elements that
you can come up with about anything in D&amp;amp;D, and it will be fun.  Each
gaming group selects those things from D&amp;amp;D that they find interesting,
customizing their play to their taste.  This is something that is
sometimes much harder in more focused games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adventurer Conqueror King System&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACKS Player's Companion&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Axioms Compendium 1-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACKS Domains at War - Battles&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lairs &amp;amp; Encounters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Capital of the Borderlands (revised edition)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Eyrie of the Dread Eye&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruined City of Cyfandir&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Secrets of the Nethercity&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Sinister Stone of Sakkara&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/07/07/recent-rpg-reading-auran-empire-primer/"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt;, some weeks ago, one book from that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Auran Empire Primer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got these because I'm planing on running some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; adventures,
possibly leading up to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;.  I got a
request from one of my players to try a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Megadungeon"&gt;megadungeon&lt;/a&gt;, and after
looking at the ones I had I decided to try out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;.  I have
both the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition?filters=0_0_1330_0"&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; versions (I backed the
kickstarter for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;), but have never played &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; before.  I
thought it would be a good opportunity to try it.  However, I didn't
want to run a new system at the same time as trying to run my first
megadungeon, so I thought I'd get some of the published &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;
adventures and run one of them first, to get myself and my players
used to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for this order to come in I've been rereading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;
core rulebook, as I already had a copy of that and the &lt;cite&gt;ACKS Player's
Companion&lt;/cite&gt;.  I admit that I found reading “Chapter 4: Proficiencies”
and “Chapter 5: Spells” slow going.  The proficiencies are sometimes
like feats and sometimes like skills and have a lot of details that
need to be read carefully.  The spells also have to be read carefully,
to see how they differ from the versions of D&amp;amp;D I've run before.  I
expect that I'll be going much faster now that I'm through those
chapters, though there may be some slogging during “Chapter 8:
Monsters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm liking what I'm reading.  I think that the things that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; adds give it a lot more depth without increasing its complexity
to &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D 1E&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D 3.5E&lt;/cite&gt; levels.  I think the players will
appreciate the increased options for their characters and I'll
appreciate the additional support for things like economic background
and domain play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I got my order I've scanned quickly over the books I got.  They
all seem interesting and useful.  I'm now reading &lt;cite&gt;The Sinister Stone
of Sakkara&lt;/cite&gt; in parallel with the core rulebook, thinking that it will
be the best introduction to the game for myself as Judge (that's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;'s term for Dungeon Master) and my players.  It is a setup
somewhat like “Keep on the Borderland” with a military fort with an
associated village and a stronghold of evil nearby.  By default It is
set on the Auran Empire's Borderlands province, which has some
interesting setting details, but once would easily place it anywhere
in ones own campaign.  One thing about it that has impressed me is the
background information it supplies on workings of the fort “Türos
Tem”, which, without becoming tedious, goes down to the amount of hay
on hand to feed the the horses of the fort's cavalry soldiers and how
long it will last and how much it cost.  Some people would say “who
would need that information?” because they run campaigns that
concentrate on wild adventure and don't sweat the background details,
but I've found in the past that having that detail can inspire ideas
for more wild adventure, and it fits into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;'s additional support
for domain play and economic underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm really looking forward to playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;.  Now I just have
to figure out a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rpgvirtualtabletop.wikidot.com/"&gt;Virtual Table Top&lt;/a&gt; (VTT) to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>acks</category><category>ad&amp;d 1e</category><category>d&amp;d</category><category>d&amp;d 3.5e</category><category>labyrinth lord</category><category>rpg</category><category>virtual table top</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/07/29/acks-pod-books-from-drivethrurpg-finally-arrived/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GURPS vs. D&amp;D vs. Dungeon Fantasy RPG</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/06/03/gurps-vs-dd-vs-dungeon-fantasy-rpg/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I played &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for a while at the beginning of my RPG career I
found out that I was interested in other games.  &lt;cite&gt;T&amp;amp;T&lt;/cite&gt;, then
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt; and many more since
then.  Eventually one of the things I figured out was that I was
looking for the different flavors that different RPG systems give the
games you play with them.  &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has a very specific flavor.  &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt;
has a very specific but different flavor.  Some of that flavor comes
from the systems and some of that flavor comes from the setting.  But
the &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; systems flavor seems to overpower the setting flavor.  (You
could say that the “implied setting elements” from the &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; core
rules have heavily flavor any &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; setting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;cite&gt;Dungeon Fantasy RPG&lt;/cite&gt; is &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; specialized for powerful
characters plundering dungeons, and because of that it adopts some
(but not all) of the cliches from &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; (druids, monks, clerics, etc),
and puts its own spin on them.  But one of the things I liked about
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; was that it &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; have the same set of cliches as &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.
Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking for the different flavors that systems imbue, I still
like generic RPGs like &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Basic
Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt;.  I like the flavor that those systems give, and I like
seeing how that interacts with the flavor of the setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>d&amp;d</category><category>dungeon fantasy rpg</category><category>gurps</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/06/03/gurps-vs-dd-vs-dungeon-fantasy-rpg/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 17:40:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Playing Classic Traveller in 2020</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/03/16/playing-classic-traveller-in-2020/</link><dc:creator>T.

&lt;h2&gt;Finally playing Classic Traveller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who was in my gaming group back in the 1980s read the
article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tor.com/2020/01/10/traveller-a-classic-science-fiction-simulator/"&gt;Traveller: A Classic Science Fiction Simulator&lt;/a&gt; at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tor.com"&gt;Tor.com&lt;/a&gt; and found it interesting.  We discussed it, and he
downloaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80190/CTSTStarter-Traveller"&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/"&gt;Drivethrurpg.com&lt;/a&gt; (it is free)
and started reading it.  I had the PDF already, and I printed it out
and started reading it as well.  I also found a physical copy for sale
on the Internet, so I ordered that as well, and it was much more
convenient to use than my printout in binders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-my-gaming-history"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;My Gaming History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with Traveller back in the 1980s was minimal: another
friend had the little black box with the three little black books
(LBBs), and we rolled up characters (which at the time seemed way
more complicated than &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, which we were used to).  Then we tried
to figure out what to do, which was not immediately obvious to us.
&lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has the obvious core activity of going down in a dungeon and
killing monsters, but Traveller was a lot more wide-open.  My
friend hadn't bought an adventure (which I find very useful for
getting an idea of core activity of a game) and he'd bought the
&lt;cite&gt;Basic Set&lt;/cite&gt;, so there wasn't an adventure in the box.  We didn't
realize that we could use the various checklists and procedures to
improvise an adventure on the spot.  So we didn't get far, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought several new editions of Traveller over the years
(&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Traveller: The New Era&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Traveller 4, Traveller
5&lt;/cite&gt;) but never found the chance to play them.  But my interest in
Classic Traveller grew once I found it being talked about in
Internet forums and blogs.  I bought a copy of the original rules
and many other LBBs, and some of the farfuture.net reprints and
CD-ROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yesterday afternoon I went over to my friend's house with my
&lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; box and some other Classic Traveller materials for
show and tell, and then we rolled up three characters each, 2D6 for
attributes in order.  I had two survive character generation (because
we were using the hardcore “you can die in character generation” rule
that was the default in Classic Traveller), both had been in the Army,
both having miserable strengths (one of them couldn't carry his rifle
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a clip of ammo; don't know how he made it through the Army),
and the weakest only had one term and the other only had two terms,
though he made Lieutenant.  My friend had one character survive
character generation, also from the Army, and he had more terms that
either of my characters, though I don't remember how many, and ended
up a Lt. Colonel if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we ran a practice combat between my friend's character and my
better character: Submachine Guns at short range (1–5 meters) in a
forest!  Classic Traveller doesn't have initiative, so everything
happens simultaneously, and we both shot the other and each had an
attribute reduced to zero, so we both fell unconscious.  After ten
minutes we both woke up, and decided to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; try to kill each other
again.  Since he had Medical-1 he used his medical kit and healed us
both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we tried our hand at what some think is &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;‘s core
activity: shipping cargo to another planet (once we finally figured
out that standard shipping of non-speculative cargo is covered in the
“REVENUE” subsection of “STARSHIP ECONOMICS”, and not near “TRADE AND
COMMERCE” section that we mistakenly thought it would be near).  So,
we rolled up some cargoes and High, Middle, and Low passages for our
arbitrarily chosen world.  Then we worked out all the expenses for our
ship, the standard Type-A Free Trader, to see if we could keep up with
them.  And we could, though there seemed to be little slack.  Success!
This lead us back to the “REQUIRED STARSHIP COMPONENTS” subsection of
the “STARSHIPS” section to figure out how much fuel was available for
maneuvering in-system after a jump.  (10 tons out of 30 tons of fuel
was available for the maneuver drive and the power plant, if I
remember correctly.)  We looked at speculative cargoes a bit, but
didn't actually try them.  We weren't sure how you found the selling
price once you were at your destination.  (A second roll on the
“Actual Value” table?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point we looked at experience and character development in
Classic Traveller.  As far as we can tell, that section is missing
from &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, though it is in the 1981 LBBs and &lt;cite&gt;The
Traveller Book&lt;/cite&gt;.  (Is it in the 1977 LBBs?  I'll have to
check. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/03/16/playing-classic-traveller-in-2020/#megatraveller" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) Anyway, basically you do a 4 year
self-improvement program, and if you succeed in staying the program
(Roll your Determination, and you need an 8+ on 2D6), the program
improves a couple of skills temporarily by 1 level of expertise.  You
can then do another 4 year program to make those gains permanent.
(There are similar but slightly different procedures for improving
physical attributes, weapons skills, and education.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we had a lot of fun.  Next time we get together we're going to
design a starship or two and try space combat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="reflections-afterward"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections Afterward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; available at DrivethruRPG.com seems
to be a better scan than the one off the Classic Traveller CD-Rom at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.farfuture.net/"&gt;farfuture.net&lt;/a&gt;, and is arranged in three separate PDF files, one for
each of the three books in the set, which is much more convenient for
printing and for viewing more than one at once on a screen.  Alas,
neither of them had select-able text, each page being a scanned image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had brought my copy of the 1977 edition of Classic Traveller, 3
digest sized (5½×8½ inches) booklets in the classic box, along with
some of the other books/supplements/adventures in that format, the
Quick Link Interactive reprint of the 1981 LBBs in one volume, and the
hardcover edition of &lt;cite&gt;The Traveller Book&lt;/cite&gt;.  I find the pamphlet format
of the original Classic Traveller books charming: they're an easy size
for reading away from the table, they seem to have lasted pretty well
over the years, and it is relatively easy to refer to two of them at
once.  On the other hand, &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;'s division into a book
of the &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt;, another book of &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt;, and a final
book with adventures, is very handy at the table where you have room
enough to have both &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; open and &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; open to
the the specific pages for the tables matching what you're reading in
&lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt;.  Also &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; has a “TYPICAL ACTIVITIES”
checklist on p. 9 of &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; (that I can't find in the
3LBBs) that basically outlines how you could improvise a Free
Trader-based adventure at the table.  The hardback &lt;cite&gt;The Traveller
Book&lt;/cite&gt; is sturdy and easy to use at the table, but not as convenient as
&lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;‘s split into &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Charts and
Tables&lt;/cite&gt;.  The &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; booklet had helpful page references to
&lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; for each of the major sections, and these were
usually a 2-page spread with all (or nearly all) of the tables for the
subject being discussed.  Despite the charming nature of the LBBs, I
think having the separate &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; book from &lt;cite&gt;Starter
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; is so convenient that we'll continue using it at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it useful to have multiple versions of Traveller available
while reading &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; to cross-check things: I found an
erratum in &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="megatraveller"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/03/16/playing-classic-traveller-in-2020/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remembered that &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; had a different
method for character advancement/experience, so I looked that up
when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn a new skill by experience, observing and trying that
skill and gaining 1 Adventure Tally (AT) per session if the referee
it played a significant part in the session.  Once you've acquired
enough ATs, you need to roll a 15 or more on 2D6 with a Dice
Modifier (DM) from Intelligence (if it is high enough) and the
number of ATs you've accumulated.  Use the same procedure to
improve a skill.  There is a similar procedure for improving
characteristics.  (This is similar to getting skill “Ticks” in
RuneQuest or other &lt;cite&gt;Basic Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt;-based systems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also learn a skill by formal training. &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; You have
to roll 7+ on 2D6 (having an applicable skill gives you a DM; the
skill depends on what kind of training you're seeking) to find the
training.  &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; You have to roll 7+ on 2D6 (with a DM from your
Determination characteristic) to stay determined to complete the
training.  Finally, &lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; You have to roll to see if you were
successful by rolling 11+ on 2D6 (with DMs from the skill you are
training if you already have it, or other related skills you
already know, and your instructors Instruction skill).  The
training takes on average 200 hours, and costs approximately Cr10
per hour.  There is a similar procedure for improving
characteristics, except for Social Standing, which can only be
improved by actually acquiring money and spending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, in contrast to Classic Traveller's
relative lack of character improvement, points out that increasing
skills and characteristics by accumulating ATs encourages
characters' participation, keeps them interested in the game, and
makes them aware of the benefits they can achieve in a session.
I'll note that this is just like leveling in &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or getting
experience points in skill based games like &lt;cite&gt;Hero System&lt;/cite&gt; or
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my quick look through the &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Players'
Manual&lt;/cite&gt; gave me the impression that &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; is just much
more complicated that Classic Traveller in every way, a typical
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"&gt;second-system effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 ends with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertain state of the Tolkien copyrights in the 1970s
(which is another story I can come back to later it you like),
it's almost certain that it was NOT the Tolkien Estate, but rather
Zaentz's Tolkien Enterprises, that sent TSR their cease &amp;amp; desist
back sometime in late 1977. Whereupon Gygax and Company at once
filed the serial numbers off, except in a few odd cases such as
"orc" (which they ludicrously began to claim came not from Tolkien
