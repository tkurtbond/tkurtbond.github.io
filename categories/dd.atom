    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple improvement on B/X D&amp;amp;D and OD&amp;amp;D that wouldn't have been a
change in the rules, just a change in presentation, that I'd wished
that the B/X and OD&amp;amp;D retro-clones had made was adding a “Saving
Throw” entry to their spell descriptions was like that of AD&amp;amp;D.  Basic
Fantasy, Labyrinth Lord/Advanced Edition Companion, Old-School
Essentials, and Sword &amp;amp; Wizardry Complete and Core all fail to do
this.  As it is, you have to read the spell description to figure out
if a saving throw is allowed and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; surprised that Old-School Essentials didn't do this,
with all its other improvements to the presentation of B/X style
games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Maybe OSE will add it in a later edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

    <title>D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide, Appendix N: Inspirational and Educational Reading</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This was originally on my site as a static page, but those don't get
added the tags page, so I moved it here as a post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master%27s_Guide"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide&lt;/a&gt; (1979), by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="appendix-n-inspirational-and-educational-reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX N: INSPIRATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL READING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiration for all of the fantasy work I have done stems directly
from the love my father showed when I was a tad, for he spent many
hours telling me stories he made up as he went along, tales of cloaked
old me who could grant wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords, or
wicked sorcerors and dauntless swordsmen.  Then too, countless
Hundreds of comic books went down, and the long-gone EC ones certainly
had their effect.  Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies were a
big influence.  In fact, all of us tend to get ample helpings of
fantasy when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those written
by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.  This often leads to reading
books of mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation of
compilations of the myths of various lands and peoples.  Upon such a
base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all
science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950.  The following
authors were of particular inspiration to me.  In some cases I cite
specific works, in others, I simply recommand all their fantasy
writing to you.  From such sources, as well as just about any other
imaginative writing or screenplay you will be able to pluck kernels
from which grow the fruits of exciting campaigns.  Good reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspirational Reading:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson, Poul. THREE HEARTS AND THREE LIONS; THE HIGH CRUSADE; THE BROKEN SWORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offutt, Andrew J., editor SWORDS AGAINST DARKNESS III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratt, Fletcher, BLUE STAR; et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelazny, Roger.  JACK OF SHADOWS; “Amber” Series; et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immediate influences upon AD&amp;amp;D were probably de Camp &amp;amp; Pratt,
REH, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, HPL, and A. Merrit; but all of the
above authors, as well as many not listed, certainly helped to shape
the form of the game.  For this reason, and for the hours of reading
enjoyment, I heartily recommend the works of these fine authors to
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RuneQuest 2E also had an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2013/11/20/runequest-appendix-n/"&gt;Appendix N&lt;/a&gt;, apparently earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once quoted Ken Hite's description of D&amp;amp;D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original D&amp;amp;D seems, quite obviously, to be a pastiche of Fritz
Leiber and Robert E. Howard adventure stories, set in a Tolkeinian
world of Moorcockian morality, using Jack Vance's magic system,
redacted for multiple protagonists. No wonder things are confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to a friend, and they were a little offended, considering it a
criticism of D&amp;amp;D.  I guess it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a criticism, but I think it is a
valid description of D&amp;amp;D.  However, I advance the theory that this
“confused” nature of D&amp;amp;D is what makes it successful, because it
provides so many different (and sometimes conflicting) elements that
you can come up with about anything in D&amp;amp;D, and it will be fun.  Each
gaming group selects those things from D&amp;amp;D that they find interesting,
customizing their play to their taste.  This is something that is
sometimes much harder in more focused games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got my order of &lt;cite&gt;Adventurer, Conqueror, King System&lt;/cite&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;) books by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.autarch.co/"&gt;Autarch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/"&gt;DriveThruRPG&lt;/a&gt; today.  The COVID-19
pandemic has really delayed their POD printing and shipping, so I was
quite some time waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books I got were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adventurer Conqueror King System&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACKS Player's Companion&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Heroic Fantasy Handbook&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Axioms Compendium 1-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACKS Domains at War - Battles&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lairs &amp;amp; Encounters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Capital of the Borderlands (revised edition)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Eyrie of the Dread Eye&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruined City of Cyfandir&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Secrets of the Nethercity&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Sinister Stone of Sakkara&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/07/07/recent-rpg-reading-auran-empire-primer/"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt;, some weeks ago, one book from that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Auran Empire Primer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got these because I'm planing on running some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; adventures,
possibly leading up to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;.  I got a
request from one of my players to try a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Megadungeon"&gt;megadungeon&lt;/a&gt;, and after
looking at the ones I had I decided to try out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;.  I have
both the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64332/Labyrinth-Lord-Revised-Edition?filters=0_0_1330_0"&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; versions (I backed the
kickstarter for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/138221/Dwimmermount-ACKS-version"&gt;Dwimmermount&lt;/a&gt;), but have never played &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; before.  I
thought it would be a good opportunity to try it.  However, I didn't
want to run a new system at the same time as trying to run my first
megadungeon, so I thought I'd get some of the published &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;
adventures and run one of them first, to get myself and my players
used to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for this order to come in I've been rereading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;
core rulebook, as I already had a copy of that and the &lt;cite&gt;ACKS Player's
Companion&lt;/cite&gt;.  I admit that I found reading “Chapter 4: Proficiencies”
and “Chapter 5: Spells” slow going.  The proficiencies are sometimes
like feats and sometimes like skills and have a lot of details that
need to be read carefully.  The spells also have to be read carefully,
to see how they differ from the versions of D&amp;amp;D I've run before.  I
expect that I'll be going much faster now that I'm through those
chapters, though there may be some slogging during “Chapter 8:
Monsters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm liking what I'm reading.  I think that the things that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt; adds give it a lot more depth without increasing its complexity
to &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D 1E&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D 3.5E&lt;/cite&gt; levels.  I think the players will
appreciate the increased options for their characters and I'll
appreciate the additional support for things like economic background
and domain play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I got my order I've scanned quickly over the books I got.  They
all seem interesting and useful.  I'm now reading &lt;cite&gt;The Sinister Stone
of Sakkara&lt;/cite&gt; in parallel with the core rulebook, thinking that it will
be the best introduction to the game for myself as Judge (that's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;'s term for Dungeon Master) and my players.  It is a setup
somewhat like “Keep on the Borderland” with a military fort with an
associated village and a stronghold of evil nearby.  By default It is
set on the Auran Empire's Borderlands province, which has some
interesting setting details, but once would easily place it anywhere
in ones own campaign.  One thing about it that has impressed me is the
background information it supplies on workings of the fort “Türos
Tem”, which, without becoming tedious, goes down to the amount of hay
on hand to feed the the horses of the fort's cavalry soldiers and how
long it will last and how much it cost.  Some people would say “who
would need that information?” because they run campaigns that
concentrate on wild adventure and don't sweat the background details,
but I've found in the past that having that detail can inspire ideas
for more wild adventure, and it fits into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;'s additional support
for domain play and economic underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm really looking forward to playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System"&gt;ACKS&lt;/a&gt;.  Now I just have
to figure out a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rpgvirtualtabletop.wikidot.com/"&gt;Virtual Table Top&lt;/a&gt; (VTT) to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

    <title>GURPS vs. D&amp;D vs. Dungeon Fantasy RPG</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I played &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; for a while at the beginning of my RPG career I
found out that I was interested in other games.  &lt;cite&gt;T&amp;amp;T&lt;/cite&gt;, then
&lt;cite&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt; and many more since
then.  Eventually one of the things I figured out was that I was
looking for the different flavors that different RPG systems give the
games you play with them.  &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has a very specific flavor.  &lt;cite&gt;Elric!&lt;/cite&gt;
has a very specific but different flavor.  Some of that flavor comes
from the systems and some of that flavor comes from the setting.  But
the &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; systems flavor seems to overpower the setting flavor.  (You
could say that the “implied setting elements” from the &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; core
rules have heavily flavor any &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; setting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;cite&gt;Dungeon Fantasy RPG&lt;/cite&gt; is &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; specialized for powerful
characters plundering dungeons, and because of that it adopts some
(but not all) of the cliches from &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; (druids, monks, clerics, etc),
and puts its own spin on them.  But one of the things I liked about
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; was that it &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; have the same set of cliches as &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;.
Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking for the different flavors that systems imbue, I still
like generic RPGs like &lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Basic
Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt;.  I like the flavor that those systems give, and I like
seeing how that interacts with the flavor of the setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2&gt;Finally playing Classic Traveller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who was in my gaming group back in the 1980s read the
article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tor.com/2020/01/10/traveller-a-classic-science-fiction-simulator/"&gt;Traveller: A Classic Science Fiction Simulator&lt;/a&gt; at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tor.com"&gt;Tor.com&lt;/a&gt; and found it interesting.  We discussed it, and he
downloaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80190/CTSTStarter-Traveller"&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/"&gt;Drivethrurpg.com&lt;/a&gt; (it is free)
and started reading it.  I had the PDF already, and I printed it out
and started reading it as well.  I also found a physical copy for sale
on the Internet, so I ordered that as well, and it was much more
convenient to use than my printout in binders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-my-gaming-history"&gt;
&lt;p class="admonition-title"&gt;My Gaming History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with Traveller back in the 1980s was minimal: another
friend had the little black box with the three little black books
(LBBs), and we rolled up characters (which at the time seemed way
more complicated than &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, which we were used to).  Then we tried
to figure out what to do, which was not immediately obvious to us.
&lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has the obvious core activity of going down in a dungeon and
killing monsters, but Traveller was a lot more wide-open.  My
friend hadn't bought an adventure (which I find very useful for
getting an idea of core activity of a game) and he'd bought the
&lt;cite&gt;Basic Set&lt;/cite&gt;, so there wasn't an adventure in the box.  We didn't
realize that we could use the various checklists and procedures to
improvise an adventure on the spot.  So we didn't get far, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought several new editions of Traveller over the years
(&lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Traveller: The New Era&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Traveller 4, Traveller
5&lt;/cite&gt;) but never found the chance to play them.  But my interest in
Classic Traveller grew once I found it being talked about in
Internet forums and blogs.  I bought a copy of the original rules
and many other LBBs, and some of the farfuture.net reprints and
CD-ROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yesterday afternoon I went over to my friend's house with my
&lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; box and some other Classic Traveller materials for
show and tell, and then we rolled up three characters each, 2D6 for
attributes in order.  I had two survive character generation (because
we were using the hardcore “you can die in character generation” rule
that was the default in Classic Traveller), both had been in the Army,
both having miserable strengths (one of them couldn't carry his rifle
&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a clip of ammo; don't know how he made it through the Army),
and the weakest only had one term and the other only had two terms,
though he made Lieutenant.  My friend had one character survive
character generation, also from the Army, and he had more terms that
either of my characters, though I don't remember how many, and ended
up a Lt. Colonel if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we ran a practice combat between my friend's character and my
better character: Submachine Guns at short range (1–5 meters) in a
forest!  Classic Traveller doesn't have initiative, so everything
happens simultaneously, and we both shot the other and each had an
attribute reduced to zero, so we both fell unconscious.  After ten
minutes we both woke up, and decided to &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; try to kill each other
again.  Since he had Medical-1 he used his medical kit and healed us
both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we tried our hand at what some think is &lt;cite&gt;Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;‘s core
activity: shipping cargo to another planet (once we finally figured
out that standard shipping of non-speculative cargo is covered in the
“REVENUE” subsection of “STARSHIP ECONOMICS”, and not near “TRADE AND
COMMERCE” section that we mistakenly thought it would be near).  So,
we rolled up some cargoes and High, Middle, and Low passages for our
arbitrarily chosen world.  Then we worked out all the expenses for our
ship, the standard Type-A Free Trader, to see if we could keep up with
them.  And we could, though there seemed to be little slack.  Success!
This lead us back to the “REQUIRED STARSHIP COMPONENTS” subsection of
the “STARSHIPS” section to figure out how much fuel was available for
maneuvering in-system after a jump.  (10 tons out of 30 tons of fuel
was available for the maneuver drive and the power plant, if I
remember correctly.)  We looked at speculative cargoes a bit, but
didn't actually try them.  We weren't sure how you found the selling
price once you were at your destination.  (A second roll on the
“Actual Value” table?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point we looked at experience and character development in
Classic Traveller.  As far as we can tell, that section is missing
from &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;, though it is in the 1981 LBBs and &lt;cite&gt;The
Traveller Book&lt;/cite&gt;.  (Is it in the 1977 LBBs?  I'll have to
check. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/03/16/playing-classic-traveller-in-2020/#megatraveller" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) Anyway, basically you do a 4 year
self-improvement program, and if you succeed in staying the program
(Roll your Determination, and you need an 8+ on 2D6), the program
improves a couple of skills temporarily by 1 level of expertise.  You
can then do another 4 year program to make those gains permanent.
(There are similar but slightly different procedures for improving
physical attributes, weapons skills, and education.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we had a lot of fun.  Next time we get together we're going to
design a starship or two and try space combat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reflections-afterward"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections Afterward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; available at DrivethruRPG.com seems
to be a better scan than the one off the Classic Traveller CD-Rom at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.farfuture.net/"&gt;farfuture.net&lt;/a&gt;, and is arranged in three separate PDF files, one for
each of the three books in the set, which is much more convenient for
printing and for viewing more than one at once on a screen.  Alas,
neither of them had select-able text, each page being a scanned image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had brought my copy of the 1977 edition of Classic Traveller, 3
digest sized (5½×8½ inches) booklets in the classic box, along with
some of the other books/supplements/adventures in that format, the
Quick Link Interactive reprint of the 1981 LBBs in one volume, and the
hardcover edition of &lt;cite&gt;The Traveller Book&lt;/cite&gt;.  I find the pamphlet format
of the original Classic Traveller books charming: they're an easy size
for reading away from the table, they seem to have lasted pretty well
over the years, and it is relatively easy to refer to two of them at
once.  On the other hand, &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;'s division into a book
of the &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt;, another book of &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt;, and a final
book with adventures, is very handy at the table where you have room
enough to have both &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; open and &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; open to
the the specific pages for the tables matching what you're reading in
&lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt;.  Also &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; has a “TYPICAL ACTIVITIES”
checklist on p. 9 of &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; (that I can't find in the
3LBBs) that basically outlines how you could improvise a Free
Trader-based adventure at the table.  The hardback &lt;cite&gt;The Traveller
Book&lt;/cite&gt; is sturdy and easy to use at the table, but not as convenient as
&lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt;‘s split into &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Charts and
Tables&lt;/cite&gt;.  The &lt;cite&gt;Core Rules&lt;/cite&gt; booklet had helpful page references to
&lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; for each of the major sections, and these were
usually a 2-page spread with all (or nearly all) of the tables for the
subject being discussed.  Despite the charming nature of the LBBs, I
think having the separate &lt;cite&gt;Charts and Tables&lt;/cite&gt; book from &lt;cite&gt;Starter
Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; is so convenient that we'll continue using it at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it useful to have multiple versions of Traveller available
while reading &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; to cross-check things: I found an
erratum in &lt;cite&gt;Starter Traveller&lt;/cite&gt; this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="megatraveller"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/03/16/playing-classic-traveller-in-2020/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remembered that &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; had a different
method for character advancement/experience, so I looked that up
when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn a new skill by experience, observing and trying that
skill and gaining 1 Adventure Tally (AT) per session if the referee
it played a significant part in the session.  Once you've acquired
enough ATs, you need to roll a 15 or more on 2D6 with a Dice
Modifier (DM) from Intelligence (if it is high enough) and the
number of ATs you've accumulated.  Use the same procedure to
improve a skill.  There is a similar procedure for improving
characteristics.  (This is similar to getting skill “Ticks” in
RuneQuest or other &lt;cite&gt;Basic Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt;-based systems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also learn a skill by formal training. &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; You have
to roll 7+ on 2D6 (having an applicable skill gives you a DM; the
skill depends on what kind of training you're seeking) to find the
training.  &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; You have to roll 7+ on 2D6 (with a DM from your
Determination characteristic) to stay determined to complete the
training.  Finally, &lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; You have to roll to see if you were
successful by rolling 11+ on 2D6 (with DMs from the skill you are
training if you already have it, or other related skills you
already know, and your instructors Instruction skill).  The
training takes on average 200 hours, and costs approximately Cr10
per hour.  There is a similar procedure for improving
characteristics, except for Social Standing, which can only be
improved by actually acquiring money and spending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt;, in contrast to Classic Traveller's
relative lack of character improvement, points out that increasing
skills and characteristics by accumulating ATs encourages
characters' participation, keeps them interested in the game, and
makes them aware of the benefits they can achieve in a session.
I'll note that this is just like leveling in &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or getting
experience points in skill based games like &lt;cite&gt;Hero System&lt;/cite&gt; or
&lt;cite&gt;GURPS&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my quick look through the &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Players'
Manual&lt;/cite&gt; gave me the impression that &lt;cite&gt;Megatraveller&lt;/cite&gt; is just much
more complicated that Classic Traveller in every way, a typical
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"&gt;second-system effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertain state of the Tolkien copyrights in the 1970s
(which is another story I can come back to later it you like),
it's almost certain that it was NOT the Tolkien Estate, but rather
Zaentz's Tolkien Enterprises, that sent TSR their cease &amp;amp; desist
back sometime in late 1977. Whereupon Gygax and Company at once
filed the serial numbers off, except in a few odd cases such as
"orc" (which they ludicrously began to claim came not from Tolkien
but from an Irish word for pig, leading to the silly-looking
pig-snouted orcs of the Monster Manual [page 76]) and 'mithral'
(which they simply decided to misspell) and otherwise went on
their merry way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Miniatures, battlemats, and terrain at my table</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started playing with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; 1E (in 1979 or 1980) we didn't use
miniatures or battle maps, it was all theater of the mind.  Since all
the players I knew personally started with &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; none of us had seen
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)"&gt;Chainmail&lt;/a&gt; or played miniatures games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved on to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd edition, (in the mid 1980s) where
a hex grid and miniatures was required, I bought a Chessex hex grid
Megamat and wet erase markers.  One of my brothers had bought a box of
miniatures (though for the life of me I cannot remember what company
it was from or what figures it contained).  We used those for player
characters.  For monsters, I cut out a bunch of ¾ inch square blocks
of wood and numbered them on the top side, put a “D” for Dead on the
bottom side, put an “S” on another smooth side for Stunned, and a “U”
for Unconscious, leaving the rough sides (where the wood was cut
against the grain) blank.  I continued to use all these when I moved
over to using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; 3rd edition, which also had specific Stunned and
and Unconscious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later I got the Steve Jackson Games Cardboard Heroes but
never could bear to cut them up, since I wasn't actively playing at
the time it came out (1999 or so?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; again with 3.5E (probably sometime
after 2004) I mostly played and didn't DM.  I was fortunate that the
DMs that I played with had good collections of pre-painted plastic
miniatures for both player characters and monsters from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Miniatures_Game"&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&lt;/a&gt;.  I did collect some of the Dungeon Tiles
(see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Tiles"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/a-complete-list-and-gallery-of-dungeon-tiles-sets/"&gt;dmdavid&lt;/a&gt;) that Wizards of the Coast published
during this time. (I actually used them playing Savage Worlds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one campaign that I DMed with 3.5E I bought an Flip Chart/Easel
Pad printed with a 1 inch grid.  I would take several sheets to the
game in a tubular storage container and draw the rooms on the map with
black marker as the players explored.  If we ran off the the side of a
sheet or went to a new level I'd get out another sheet and draw on
that.  This worked surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One GM had a fair bit of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dwarvenforge.com/"&gt;Dwarven Forge&lt;/a&gt; terrain and that was a lot
of fun to play on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started playing &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Worlds"&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (around 2005) I did a lot of
GMing, and was thrilled by the Figure Flats and map tiles that that
Great White Games (now known again as Pinnacle Entertainment Group —
PEG) included in many of their Savage Tales PDF adventures.  I had a
printer that could print on card stock, so these were ideal for
me.  Later PEG products, such as their Plot Point campaigns, often had
Figure Flats as separate PDF accessories.  I found them all very
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/51074/eAdventure-Tiles-Introductory-Set"&gt;e-Adventure Tiles&lt;/a&gt; series from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/80/SkeletonKey-Games"&gt;SkeletonKey Games&lt;/a&gt;
very useful.  These &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Geomorphic_Map_Tiles"&gt;geomorphic map tiles&lt;/a&gt; are 6×6 inch squares, marked
with a 1 inch square grid, and by printing them out and putting them
together you can produce an infinite variety of maps.  I found them
most useful when printed on cardstock and labeled on the back with
their id number.  I'd make up several maps and then sort out the
printed tiles for that map into a manila envelope for easy
retrieval. There used to be a program that you could use the small
preview images from the tiles (which were considerately set up for
easy Copy and Paste from the PDF) to lay out your map at the small
scale and then print it for reference when later putting together the
large tiles. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#tiamat" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; I'd include those in the manila envelope with
the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/667/Arion-Games"&gt;Arion Games&lt;/a&gt; and Disposable Heroes
paper miniatures from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27"&gt;Precis Intermedia&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147348073/Paper-Wars---Dragon-Pass-at-War"&gt;Paper Wars -
Dragon Pass at War&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Glorantha paper miniatures
published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgpublisher/10024/unspoken-word"&gt;The Unspoken Word&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to have been drawn by
Simon Bray, Dario Corallo, and Sarah Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the early paper miniatures that I used were tri-fold and were
cut out, folded, and glued (or taped) together.  They usually had
front sides in color and a back side in black and white.
Unfortunately, these take up almost as much room as lead or plastic
miniatures, though were much lighter to carry.  I stored them in cheap
plastic food containers, which let me easily see what was inside them.
Carrying enough of them to games outside my home was a bulky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved to A-frame paper miniatures, where there are two
sides and they are attached at the top, with tabs that fold out or in
at the bottom for a base.  Instead of relying on the tabs to form the
base, I used plastic &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=27_96"&gt;stands&lt;/a&gt; from Precis Intermedia, where you'd just
fold the miniature once and stick it in the stand.  The stands add a bit
of weight to the miniatures and make them much more stable.  If you
cut out a front that is attached to a back, instead of all three
sides, you can just fold them once and stick them in a stand as well,
so I could use all my trifold paper miniatures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zenseeker.net/PaperMiniatures/DIY.htm"&gt;Zen DIY Paper Miniatures Page&lt;/a&gt; has some pictures of A-frame and
trifold paper miniatures.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these paper miniatures are flat when not inserted into stands I
currently organize my paper miniatures into separate small manila
envelopes for each type of creature, labeled with the creature type on
the outside.  Occasionally I use small ziplock bags, especially for
the PCs' miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper miniatures described above are all drawn in such a way that
the figure is drawn within a rectangle and you can cut them out with
long straight cuts and cross cuts.  There is another style of paper
miniatures drawn in a manner so that you cut out the irregular outline
of the figure itself with many small or curving cuts.  These are much
harder to cut out, and are more difficult to store, but are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
impressive to look at.  (You can see some examples in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/monsters.html"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;
collection at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onemonk.com/"&gt;One Monk Miniatures&lt;/a&gt;) That's too much work for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a Steel Sqwire Flip Mat, which uses dry erase pens, and it
is 24×30 inches and folds up into an 8×10 inch package only a ¼ inch
thick or so.  Much easier to carry around, since it fits into the same
backpack or messenger bag I use to carry my RPG books and
accessories. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#accessories" id="id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; More over, unlike the ones you can find
now published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8oto?GameMastery-FlipMat-Basic"&gt;Paizo&lt;/a&gt;, it had both 1 inch squares and 1 inch hexes,
perfect for DragonQuest, GURPS, or The Fantasy Trip, though I've used
mostly the squared side, for Savage Worlds.  The dry erase pens are
much more satisfactory than the wet erase pens.  For some time I
haven't had extra time to lay out locations using paper map tiles, and
the Flip Mat lets me quickly draw out locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually use miniatures and a battle map for Savage Worlds
there have been several occasions where I've run games in theater of
the mind style, without any miniatures or battle map.  It takes a
little adapting, but isn't that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current practice is to use paper miniatures in stands for player
characters and numbered blocks for opponents, with a Flip Mat as the
battle map.  Some times for opponents that take up more than one
square I'll fold over or cut up a 3×5 or 4×6 card and use that,
writing an arrow to indicate which way is the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/melee/"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/wizard/"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; style counters, which lie flat on
the table, but I got in on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-legacy-edition/"&gt;The Fantasy Trip Legacy Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/the-fantasy-trip-old-school-roleplaying"&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and am intending to try them out sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when running &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision"&gt;B/X D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/pages/rpg-vocabulary/#retro-clone"&gt;retro-clones&lt;/a&gt; there of
(like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goblinoidgames.com/"&gt;Goblinoid Games&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;cite&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_Lord"&gt;L1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/760/Goblinoid-Games/subcategory/2033_6311/Labyrinth-Lord"&gt;L2&lt;/a&gt;), it's &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;
inspired &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78523/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Edition Companion&lt;/a&gt;, or the book that squashes them
together: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259983/Advanced-Labyrinth-Lord-Dragon-Cover?cPath=2033_6311"&gt;Advanced Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt;, or like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/"&gt;Necrotic Gnome&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials"&gt;Old
School Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/"&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;) it's all theater of the
mind: no miniatures, no battle map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="tiamat"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program that I used was a desktop application rather
than a web-based application, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpgobjects.com/index.php?c=tiamat"&gt;Tiamat the Tile Mapper&lt;/a&gt; is a
similar application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="accessories"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/miniatures-and-battlemaps-at-my-table/#id4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice of course; usually I carry a couple of extra
sets for when someone forgets their dice.  For Savage Worlds I
carry several differently colored sets of glass beads (stored in
small ziplock bags). I use blue beads for bennies, white beads for
GM bennies, red beads for wounds, yellow beads for shaken and white
beads again for fatigue.  I've found it helps the players (and
myself) to remember their status if they have physical objects
sitting on their character sheet to remind them.  When playing with
numbered blocks for opponents I put the shaken bead on top of the
block; this really helps when I've got 30 opponents on the table.
I carry a couple of decks of playing cards for Savage Worlds
initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran across an interesting article: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107143330/http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com:80/2012/02/d-next-zones-of-control-from-chainmail.html"&gt;D&amp;amp;D Next: "Zones of Control"
from Chainmail to 4e&lt;/a&gt; which argues, I think with good evidence, that
every version of &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; has been based in miniatures as its default
mode of play.  (Alas the original site of this article, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.advanceddungeonsandparenting.com"&gt;Advanced
Dungeons &amp;amp; Parenting&lt;/a&gt; appears to having fallen to some annoying
entropy creating demons.  Some poking about seems to show the original
author being Christian Lindke of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.geekeratimedia.com/"&gt;Geekerati&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split between abstract combat and miniatures combat was well
established by the time I started with &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt;, reading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1977_version"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/02/20/every-edition-of-dd-has-specified-some-things-in-terms-of-miniatures/#holmes" id="id4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; edition and then playing first edition &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;.  We never
played with miniatures.  Indeed, I think the hex grid and miniatures
based tactical combat rules were one of the things that drew me to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest"&gt;DragonQuest&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm irritated that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast"&gt;Wizards of the Coast&lt;/a&gt; has not yet

    <title>Gygax on Character Death</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/turning-dd-character-deaths-into-deal-that-benefits-game-and-story/"&gt;Turning Character Deaths in D&amp;amp;D Into Deals that
Benefit Game and Story&lt;/a&gt;, David Hartlage (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/"&gt;DM David&lt;/a&gt;) points out an
interesting quote from Gary Gygax in the &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; on Character Death.  (The
whole post is worth reading, as are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/start-here-my-most-popular-and-favorite-posts/"&gt;many of his others&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went looking for the quote so I could give a more complete reference
for it.  (PDF versions of old gaming books are wonderful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first edition &lt;cite&gt;AD&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master%27s_Guide#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons"&gt;Dungeon Master's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, on p. 110, in the
section “Conducting the Game”, subsection “Rolling the Dice and
Control of the Game”, Gary Gygax wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then a player will die through no fault of his own. He or
she will have done everything correctly, taken every reasonable
precaution, but still the freakish roll of the dice will kill the
character. In the long run you should let such things pass as the
players will kill more than one opponent with their own freakish
rolls at some later time. Yet you do have the right to arbitrate
the situation. You can rule that the player, instead of dying, is
knocked unconscious, loses a limb, is blinded in one eye or invoke
any reasonably severe penalty that still takes into account what
the monster has done. It is very demoralizing to the players to
lose a cared-for-player character when they have played well. When
they have done something stupid or have not taken precautions,
then let the dice fall where they may!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, every time I read the original &lt;cite&gt;DMG&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at
everything that Gygax managed to fit into that book.  Of course, when
I read the three booklets of original &lt;cite&gt;D&amp;amp;D&lt;/cite&gt; I'm amazed at what he
managed to fit in those as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
