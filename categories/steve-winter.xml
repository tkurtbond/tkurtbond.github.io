Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.howlingtower.com/"&gt;Steve Winter&lt;/a&gt; (ex-TSR, ex-WotC):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, TSR studied the sales appeal of AD&amp;amp;D compared to
“Basic” D&amp;amp;D (Basic/Expert, B/X, or BECMI, as it’s now known). The
common wisdom was that Basic D&amp;amp;D was the best choice for beginning
players because it was a simpler game—it had fewer rules. New and
inexperienced players, however, actually saw that paucity of rules as
a drawback. To them, Basic D&amp;amp;D was more complex than Advanced D&amp;amp;D, not
less, because the DM and players were faced with more situations that
had no clear solution. In contrast, AD&amp;amp;D told you exactly (or
approximately) what to do in an enormous range of situations. The
answers might be hard to find, but they were in those books
somewhere. Extensive rules that covered more situations translated to
the DM spending more time flipping pages in a search for answers but
less time sifting through options. The end result was a perception
that while AD&amp;amp;D had more rules than Basic D&amp;amp;D, all those rules made it
easier to play. Inexperienced players liked the confidence that came
from AD&amp;amp;D providing all the answers, so they gravitated toward
AD&amp;amp;D. Experienced players liked having open-ended options and were the
main audience for Basic D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result surprised a lot of people inside TSR. It was an
eye-opener, and it affected design and marketing philosophy for years.&lt;/p&gt;
