Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I just got my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_of_Wonder_(game)"&gt;Worlds of Wonder&lt;/a&gt; box set from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobleknight.com/"&gt;Noble Knight&lt;/a&gt;.  It
was published by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.chaosium.com/"&gt;Chaosium&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, and consists of 4 pamphlets —
&lt;cite&gt;Basic Role-Playing&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Magic World&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Super World&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Future
World&lt;/cite&gt;, each under 20 pages — and some supporting game aids.  It was
very interesting to see Chaosium's house system be stripped down so
much in &lt;cite&gt;Basic Role-Playing&lt;/cite&gt;, and then built up again slightly in each
of the genre specific pamphlets.  There are some interesting design
decisions there.  I'm not sure that all of those same decisions were
exactly included in the Big Gold Book version of Chaosium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.chaosium.com/basic-roleplaying-softcover/"&gt;Basic
Roleplaying&lt;/a&gt; book published in 2010, which collected rules from most
of Chaosium's games into one generic roleplaying game.  I'll have to
compare them to see.  I should also compare it to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.chaosium.com/content/FreePDFs/BRP/CHA2021%20-%20Basic%20RolePlaying%20Quick-Start.pdf"&gt;BRP
Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;.  I do have Chaosium's 2002 publication of the
&lt;cite&gt;Basic Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt; pamphlet.  It was better typeset but was otherwise
functionally identical to the pamphlet from &lt;cite&gt;Worlds of Wonder&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see a PDF version of &lt;cite&gt;Worlds of Wonder&lt;/cite&gt;, even if it was
just a scanned version.  Even better if it was release as an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document"&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;,
like their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.chaosium.com/brp-system-reference-document/"&gt;BRP SRD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>basic roleplaying</category><category>big gold book</category><category>brp</category><category>chaosium</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/12/01/worlds-of-wonder-from-chaosium/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:17:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>RuneQuest Versions</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2012/06/11/runequest-versions/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I can never remember the publication dates of the various versions of
&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, so here's a list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; (1978), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chaosium.com"&gt;Chaosium&lt;/a&gt;.  AKA RuneQuest I, RQI, RQ1.  Was set
in the world of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, second edition (1980), Chaosium.  AKA RuneQuest II,
RQII, RQ2.  Was set in the world of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, third edition (1984), Avalon Hill.  AKA RuneQuest III,
RQ3.  Used Fantasy Europe as the example setting, but also had
a lot of Glorantha publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published as a box set, it was republished as a paperback
book in the US in the early 1990s during the brief but productive
RuneQuest Renaissance ushered in by the new RuneQuest editor at
Avalon Hill, Ken Rolston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest: Adventures in Glorantha&lt;/cite&gt;, (never published
commercially), Avalon Hill.  AKA RQIV and RQ:AiG on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt; (2006), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/"&gt;Mongoose Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.  AKA MRQ on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was published as an setting-independent fantasy system (under
the OGL), but Mongoose also had a license to publish material about
the “Second Age” of the world of Glorantha and published a lot of
Glorantha specific books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, second edition (2010), Mongoose Publishing. AKA MRQ2 on
the Internet.  (Mongoose called this “RuneQuest II”, and books for
this edition usually have a RQII logo on their cover.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;RuneQuest&lt;/cite&gt;, sixth edition (announced 16 July 2011), &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thedesignmechanism.com/"&gt;The Design
Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll not go into the related histories of the related &lt;cite&gt;Basic
Roleplaying&lt;/cite&gt; games from Chaosium, nor the completely different system
&lt;cite&gt;HeroQuest&lt;/cite&gt; which also used the setting of Glorantha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more RuneQuest history see Pete Maranci's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.maranci.net/rqpast.htm"&gt;The History of
RuneQuest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.maranci.net/rq.htm"&gt;Pete's RuneQuest &amp;amp; Roleplaying!&lt;/a&gt; for more on
RuneQuest in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mongoose released a new RPG, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/legend.html"&gt;Legend&lt;/a&gt;, using the mechanics from their
RuneQuest, second edition, under the OGL.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>basic roleplaying</category><category>brp</category><category>chaosium</category><category>heroquest</category><category>history</category><category>legend</category><category>mongoose</category><category>mrq</category><category>mrq2</category><category>rpg</category><category>rq1</category><category>rq2</category><category>rq3</category><category>rq6</category><category>rq:aig</category><category>rqi</category><category>rqii</category><category>rqiii</category><category>rqiv</category><category>runequest</category><category>the design mechanism</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2012/06/11/runequest-versions/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 02:41:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chaosium</title><link>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2004/08/10/2004-08-10/</link><dc:creator>T. Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Chaosium seems to be trying to get things published in a more timely
fashion.  Probably for cash-flow reasons (ever the bane of the small
RPG publisher) this seems to be reflected mostly in their Miskatonic
University Library Association Monographs series, which are digitally
produced small run publications in cardstock covers and tape bindings,
with all the editing and layout done by the authors.  This should give
them an opportunaty to produce interesting works faster with minimal
costs, as well as give them a less risky venue for experimenting.  I
hope it works well for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen any of these yet, but several look interesting from
their descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First Book of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Michael C. LaBossiere. This looks
like a fun collection of creatures, technology, and magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mysteries of Morocco&lt;/em&gt;, by William Jones.  A “civil, geographical,
cultural, political, and a Mythos tour of Morocco during the 1920s and
1930s”, covering several locations and including a scenario and
several maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cthulhu Invictus&lt;/em&gt;, by Chad Bowser, Andi Newton, and Deane P.
Goodwin.  “Horror Roleplaying in Ancient Rome.” I presume from the
name that this involves the Cthulhu Mythos in ancient Rome, but I
think that you could easily find enough horror without it.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-6530607-2018313"&gt;Thomas
Harlan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;em&gt;Oath of Empire&lt;/em&gt; series would be good
inspiration for this, if rather later than what we normally think of
when talking about ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the &lt;em&gt;Player's Book&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Magic Book&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Runequest&lt;/em&gt;,
3rd edition were available for a couple of days as the &lt;em&gt;BRP Player's
Book&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;BRP Magic Book&lt;/em&gt;, but were apparently removed after a
more plan for republishing them was conceived and put into motion.  It
certainly would be interesting to see a &lt;em&gt;Runequest&lt;/em&gt;-derived core RPG
published in the modern world.  Of course, between &lt;em&gt;Call of Cthulhu&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;Stormbringer&lt;/em&gt; one already has all the necessary rules in print,
but it would be nice to see them all presented in one package, well
edited and integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possibility of this and the actuality of the republishing of
the West End Games house system as a (more-or-less) generic system it
will be interesting to see how they succeed in the market against
existing universal systems such as &lt;em&gt;GURPS&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hero&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tri-Stat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chaosium</category><category>old blog</category><category>rpg</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2004/08/10/2004-08-10/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2004 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
