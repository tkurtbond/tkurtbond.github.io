Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in college in the 1980s the school I was at used Digital
Equipment Corporation VAXes running VMS, and didn't have any Unix
machines.  I was quite interested in Unix and the Unix philosophy, but
was frustrated by my lack of access to Unix machines.  However,
Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger wrote a couple of books about
writing tools in the Unix style: &lt;cite&gt;Software Tools&lt;/cite&gt; was in
published in 1976 and used Fortran as its portable implementation
language, while &lt;cite&gt;Software Tools in Pascal&lt;/cite&gt; was published in
1981 and used Pascal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote repeated on each book's cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing
how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy to
maintain and modify, human-engineered, efficient, and reliable, by
the application of common sense and good programming practices.
Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better
writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both books worked through writing software tools that were simpler but
still useful versions of many of the standard Unix tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;cite&gt;Software Tools in Pascal&lt;/cite&gt; because I knew Pascal better
than Fortran and worked through implementing each of the programs on
the college's VAX, which taught me a lot about programming and was
significant influence on me.  I later got &lt;cite&gt;Software Tools&lt;/cite&gt;
because I wanted to read the section on implementing the ratfor
processor which that book used to add additional control structures
unavailable in the Fortran of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not the only person who was influenced by these books.
Deborah K. Scherrer, Dennis E. Hall, and Joseph S. Sventek at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory with help from others greatly expanded
the set of programs from the book into an entire Virtual Operating
System (VOS), and founded the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Tools_Users_Group"&gt;Software Tools Users Group&lt;/a&gt; in 1976
to distribute it, eventually leading to ports on over 50 operating
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me VAX/VMS was one of those operating systems, and the
port appeared on various tapes distributed by DECUS, the Digital
Equipment Computer Users' Society.  Luckily MPL Corporation, where I
worked at the time, always got the DECUS tapes and had a Fortran
compiler, so I could install it there.  I found it a very useful and
usable computing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I retain a fondness for that software, known variously as
LBLTOOLS, LBL SWTOOLS, and LBL VOS, and have begun using the version
from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digiater.nl/openvms/decus/zips_vms_attributes/lt86a.zip"&gt;DECUS VAX Languages &amp;amp; Tools SIG tape from 1986&lt;/a&gt;
again on the (emulated) VAX I maintain at work.  This gave me the
opportunity create a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io/swtoolsman.pdf"&gt;PDF with the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
for that version, which I'm making available here for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really enjoyed that book.  The first computer book I read where
I thought my world was larger after reading it.” — C. Paul Bond&lt;/p&gt;

Kurt Bond</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL"&gt;Cobol&lt;/a&gt;, and have written it for work, but not for a long time,
maybe 30 years? No, I lie, I did some a decade or two ago.  It was not
my favorite programming language, but knowing it helped pay the
bills.  At my college in the mid-80s it was taught by the Business
department rather than the Computer Science department!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my Cobol jobs was porting code from the IBM mainframes to VMS
on a Digital Equipment Corporation mini-computer, the VAX.  A more
recent one was fixing bugs and making enhancements to some student
management software at a nearby college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What little Fortran I've written was in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor"&gt;ratfor&lt;/a&gt; (Rational Fortran)
dialect, on VMS, using the Software Tools package written at Lawrence
Berkeley Labs, which ported a lot of Unix tools to VMS (and IBM
mainframes) using ratfor (a dialect that was first invented on Unix to
add modern control structures to Fortran 66, and implemented
as a preprocessor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite programming books is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X/ref=sr_1_3"&gt;Software Tools&lt;/a&gt; by Brian
Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (I first read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Pascal-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0201103427/ref=sr_1_4"&gt;Software Tools in
Pascal&lt;/a&gt; version), which showed how to write Unix like tools
in Ratfor (because at the time Fortran was more portable than C!).  It
was the inspiration for the LBL Software tools package.  I wish I
still had the LBL Software Tools on the VAX I maintain (running on a
software emulator on Intel hardware, at much faster speeds than the
original VAX), but it was deleted to save space long ago in an era of
expensive hard drives, a decision I've long regretted!  I can find the
source online, but I can't find a binary distribution, and that VAX
doesn't have a Fortran compiler anymore, alas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cobol</category><category>fortran</category><category>ratfor</category><guid>https://tkurtbond.github.io/posts/2020/12/10/cobol-and-fortran/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 16:06:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
