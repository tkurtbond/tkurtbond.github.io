Another excellent collection of heroic fantasy edited by Karl Edward Wagner. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I had read all the fiction before, by Robert E. Howard, C. L. Moore, (with Henry Kuttner and Forest J. Ackerman as coauthors on different stories), Leigh Brackett with Ray Bradbury as coauthor, and Manly Wade Wellman, but I was glad to read them again. KEW's introductions are worth reading, as were the nonfiction giving the stories context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I greatly enjoyed this collection.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; known about C.L. Moore's disappearance from the science
fiction scene and her struggle with Alzheimer's disease and her
eventual coma and finally death on April 4th, 1987.  I don't remember
having read C.L. Moore at that time; I came to it much later, when I
was reading swords and sorcery and sword and planet fiction in the
2000s, rereading old favorites and reading stories I'd not read
before.  That's also when I read the Leigh Brackett and Ray Bradbury
story in this collection, though I'd read her John Eric Stark stories
and novels sometime before.  And the 2000s is also probably when I
first read Manly Wade Wellman's stories of Hok the Mighty.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Excellent collection of what I've read Wagner prefered to call heroic fantasy, but which is often called sword &amp;amp; sorcery. I had already read Howard's "The Black Stranger", first in its rewritten version ad a pirate story, "Swords of the Red Brotherhood", with Conan replaced with Howard's swashbuckling hero Black Vulmea, and later in its original form in the Del Rey trade paperback collection &lt;i&gt;The Conquering Sword of Conan&lt;/i&gt;, but it was good to read it again. I was also familiar with Leiber's "Adept's Gambit", and enjoyed rereading it as well. Kuttner's "Wet Magic" was new to me, and I liked it, though not as well as the Howard and Leiber stories.
