When I was younger I delighted in reading new game systems and
settings, interested in learning them all.  As I've gotten older, I've
gotten less interested in reading new game systems and settings.  I'm
not sure whether it is just that I have less interest, or that there
are just so many systems and settings.  (I also tend to have more
trouble with wall-of-text in general; I'm not sure I want all the
detail of some of the RuneQuest 3 Renaissance books, although I
enjoyed them immensely when I first read them.)

In any case, I'm currently enjoying reading three related games:
Lightmaster (Core_, Tables_), `HARP Fantasy`_, and `Against the
Darkmaster` (PDF_, website_, Print_, `Open License`_)_, all games in
the mold of Iron Crown Enterprises' Rolemaster_ and `Middle-earth Role
Playing`_ (MERP).

All of these game systems are very much in the “lots of tables to look
up results, especially criticals!” category.  And they typically have
lots of skills, calculated based on various tables.
 
`Lightmaster` is a interesting retro-clone that simplifies the
Rolemaster/MERP open-ended d100 role with a open-ended d20, oddly uses
the standard D&D abilities, comes up with it's own “sailing ships in
space” setting, and drops most of the humanoid races common in fantasy
RPGs.  Best of all, it's free in PDF, and there is a POD option as
well.

`HARP Fantasy` seems to be an interesting distillation and
simplification of `Rolemaster` and `MERP`, in a reasonably small,
dense book package of 274 pages.  It streamlines the detail of the
critical tables considerably.  It also has a POD option and several
supplements.

I bounced off of the `Rolemaster` 1\ :sup:`st` edition boxed set of
`Arms Law`, `Claw Law`, `Spell Law`, `Character Law`, and `Campaign
Law` I bought back in the day (????).  And I bounced off `MERP`
