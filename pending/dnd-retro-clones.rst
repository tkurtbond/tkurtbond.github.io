D&D Retro-clones and Neo-clones
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

(See `Retro-clone`_ and `Neo-clone`_ for definitions.)

.. _Retro-clone: link://slug/rpg-vocabulary#Retro-clone
.. _Neo-clone: link://slug/rpg-vocabulary#Neo-clone

All of the retro-clones and neo-clones mentioned below are games with
which I have some familiarity.  Many of them I've played.  The others
I've read.  All of them have something interesting to recommend them.

There was a time when Wizards of the Coast hadn't made old versions of
D&D available easily, and the retro-clones were very important then.
Even now some retro-clones or neo-clones have better presentation than
the original rules (`Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy`_) or
present a simpler version of classic rules (`Labyrinth Lord: Revised
Edition`_ with `Advanced Edition Companion`_ for AD&D), or provide
additional details and further development of a particular D&D version
(`Adventurer, Conqueror, King System`_).

And, of course, if you are playing with kids who might not have the
money to buy PDFs of old versions of D&D, many of the retro-clones are
available in PDF or online legally for free.

What do you want?
=================

Want a simple, clear, exceptionally well organized and presented
version of the classic `Basic/Expert D&D`_ (B/X) rules?  See
`Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy`_.

.. _Basic/Expert D&D: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1981_revision

Want races separate from classes and the most of the extra classes,
races, and many spells from AD&D 1E, all on the 1 to 14 level scale of
the classic `Basic/Expert D&D`_ (B/X)?  See `Old-School Essentials
Advanced Fantasy`_.

Want to play classic AD&D 1E modules with all races, classes, and most
spells from AD&D 1E, on a mostly 1 to 20 level scale, with 9\
:sup:`th` level magic user spells and 7\ :sup:`th` cleric spells, but
with simpler mechanics?  See `Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition &
Advanced Edition Companion`_, or `Advanced Labyrinth Lord`_.

Want something almost like AD&D 1E?  See OSRIC_.

Want something that feels like `Original D&D`_, just what was in the
three original Little Brown Books?  See `Swords & Wizardry Whitebox`_,
`Labyrinth Lord`\'s `Original Edition Characters`_, or `Delving
Deeper`_.  Do you also want the thief class?  See `Swords & Wizardry
Core`_.

.. _Original D&D: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(1974)

Want something that feels like `Original D&D`_, just before AD&D 1E
came out, with the races and classes (except for gnomes and
illusionists) and spells familiar from AD&D 1E, but simpler, on a
mostly 1 to 20+ level scale, with up to 9\ :sup:`th` level magic user
spells and 7\ :sup:`th` level cleric spells?  See `Swords & Wizardry
Complete`_.

Like the 1 to 14 level scale and the lower hit dice of `Basic/Expert
D&D`_, but want more detailed rules, especially magic research,
economics, and domain play (the D&D end game, where the players build
strongholds and rule), with rules for building campaign specific
classes and races, and don't mind some slightly different mechanics?
See the `Adventurer, Conqueror, King System`_.

Want the 1 to 36 level scale of Frank Mentzer's BECMI_ rules or Aaron
Allston's `Rules Cyclopedia`_?  See `Dark Dungeons`_.

.. _BECMI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1983_revision
.. _Rules Cyclopedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set#1991_revision

Basic Fantasy
=============

I *think* I looked at `Basic Fantasy`_ first, but it wasn't what I
was looking for at the time.

All its PDFs are free, and the print on demand books are *very*
inexpensive.

I notice that the character class tables all go to
level 20.  I wonder if this is a residual artifact of the `D&D 3E`_
character classes going to level 20, since it doesn't match the B/X
model that that is implied by the Basic Fantasy website with the
statement “The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game
system modeled on the classic RPG rules of the early 1980's.”
Compare that to Labyrinth Lord's rescaling of B/X to match
AD&D.

Labyrinth Lord
==============

Original Edition Characters
---------------------------

`Original Edition Characters` is a player's supplement for `Labyrinth
Lord` that provides characters more like those of `Original D&D`_.
(OECPDF_, OECPOD_)

.. _OECPDF: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/58558/Original-Edition-Characters?manufacturers_id=760
.. _OECPOD: https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/daniel-proctor/original-edition-characters/paperback/product-1yvzkkwd.html

Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition & Advanced Edition Companion
------------------------------------------------------------

While `Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition`_ (LLRE; PDF and POD) has been
criticized for not being a completely faithful retro-clone of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D rules (B/X), I think it still
holds a useful spot.  The changes that were made in the revised
version of `Labyrinth Lord` made it easier to be used with `Advanced
Edition Companion`_ (AEC).  It adapted the 1–14 level scale of B/X to
the scale of AD&D 1E, generally about 20 levels, and with AEC it added
the separate races and the additional classes, spells, monsters, and
magic items of AD&D 1E.

There are versions of LLRE and AEC available for free: `No-art LLRE`_ and
`no-art AEC`_.

Advanced Labyrinth Lord
-----------------------

`Advanced Labyrinth Lord` compiles the information from `Labyrinth
Lord: Revised Edition` and `Advanced Edition Companion` into one
convenient book (ALL_, PDF and POD).

Swords & Wizardry
=================

`Swords & Wizardry` is inspired by the original D&D booklets and
associated magazine articles.  It comes in various versions, depending
on how much of the supplemental material you want.

I find the original D&D booklets very interesting from a historical
standpoint, but find `Swords & Wizardry` easier to use at the table.

.. _Swords & Wizardry SRD: http://www.swordsnwizardry.com/

Swords & Wizardry White Box
---------------------------

This is inspired by the original three booklets of D&D, so it includes
only the Fighter, Magic-User, and Cleric, so it strips away everything
but the absolute essentials.

.. _Swords & Wizardry WhiteBox: https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/matthew-finch/swords-wizardry-whitebox-rules-softcover/paperback/product-1wzw887q.html?page=1&pageSize=4


Swords & Wizardry Core
----------------------

This adds the thief class.

.. _Swords & Wizardry Core: https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/matthew-finch/swords-wizardry-core-rules-softcover/paperback/product-1yvrdzg2.html?


Swords & Wizardry Complete
--------------------------

If you are looking to play something with the feel of AD&D 1E, but
want something even simpler than `Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition`_
and `Advanced Edition Companion`_, this is an excellent choice, as
long as you don't need half-orcs, gnomes or illusionists.

I like how it discusses different ways to interpret the original
rules, often giving more than option for use with S&WC.

Old-School Essentials
=====================

`Old-School Essentials` (OSE) is published by `Necrotic Gnome`_ in two
flavors so far, `Classic Fantasy` and `Advanced Fantasy`.

.. _Necrotic Gnome: https://necroticgnome.com/

In my opinion, OSE has improved the clarity, organization, and
presentation of its rules over the already very good `Basic/Expert
D&D`_ rules.\ [#although]_ As well as clear wording it uses layout and
typography to enhance its presentation of the rules, from the use of
one and two page spreads that completely cover one subject to the
careful use of bold and bullet points to call out important
information, OSE really shines.  The adventures_ that `Necrotic
Gnome`_ have produced for it (`The Hole in the Oak`_, `Winter's
Daughter`_, `The Incandescent Grottoes`_, `The Isle of the Plangent
Mage`_, `Halls of the Blood King`_, and `Holy Mountain Shaker`_)
continue this excellent use of layout, bold, and bullet points to
present their information clearly and without the dreaded “wall of
text” or “read aloud text”.

.. _adventures: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures
.. _The Hole in the Oak: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures/products/the-hole-in-the-oak

.. _Holy Mountain Shaker: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/adventures/products/holy-mountain-shaker

.. [#although]

   Although it has been suggested to me that while OSE excels *as a
   reference*, the original `Basic/Expert D&D`_ rules have more
   explanations of why things work as they do.  I need to reread them
   in light of this suggestion.



Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy
-------------------------------------

`Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy` (OSECF_) is the best organized
and presented version of the classic rules from the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh
Basic/Expert D&D sets.  This is the game that I wish had been around
when I started playing.  There is an SRD (OSESRD_).  I particularly
like the Classic Fantasy Rules Tome, which collects everything into
one substantial book, but there is also a version split into multiple
books covering separate sections of the rules, so that the magic-user
can look up his spells while the fighter is looking at the combat
rules.

.. _OSECF: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-rules-tome
.. _OSESRD: https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/

Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy
--------------------------------------

`Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy` is the best organized and
presented version of the ideas of the classic rules from 1\
:sup:`st` edition AD&D, scaled to match the 1–14 level scope of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D sets.  If I was starting a new
D&D campaign these are the rules I'd use, all things being equal.

`Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy` is collected in the `Player's
Tome`_ and `Referee's Tome`_.

.. _Player's Tome: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy-players-tome
.. _Referee's Tome: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy-referees-tome


Adventurer, Conqueror, King System
==================================

The name of this system is usually abbreviated as ACKS.  One of its
explicit design goals for to supply more rules for the end of game of
Original D&D, where the players built strongholds and ruled, hence the
name.  It also has a more detailed economic system.  It is more
complicated than OD&D or B/X, but in a completely different way than
AD&D 1E.

It uses some different mechanics, especially for “to hit” roles, so it
might be considered a `Neo-Clone`_, but it is inspired by B/X D&D, and
keeps to the same 1 to 14 level scale of B/X.  I particularly like its
rules for building your own campaign specific classes from the
`Player's Companion`.

OSRIC
=====

I looked at OSRIC (OSRICKnK_), (a free `OSRIC PDF`_ is available, as
well as a free PDF of the `Usherwood Publishing`_ `OSRIC Pocket SRD`_
version) but was more interested in `Basic/Expert D&D`_ retroclones at
the time.  I think it is a well written, organized, and presented
restatement of AD&D 1E.  The `Black Blade Publishing`_ print edition
is a very nice offset printed volume with a sewn spine.  The `Usherwood
Publishing`_ `OSRIC Pocket SRD`_ (PDF, POD) is quite affordable.  I
just wish OSRIC wasn't missing some of the classes.  (I miss the Monk
in particular.)  I was also surprised by how many of the little quirks
and restrictions of AD&D 1E have been ironed out, although many
remain.  `Usherwood Publishing`_ has some supplements that add some of
the missing classes, though I'm not sure I like all their versions.

Dark Dungeons
=============

`Dark Dungeons` is available in a free PDF (DDFreePDF_), a hardback
(DDHardback_), a paperback (DDPaperback_), and a deluxe color edition
(DDDeluxe_).  It has a `home page`_.

This is a retro-clone of The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.

`Dark Dungeons` does have changes_ from the Rules Cyclopedia,
integrating some optional rules, extrapolating, clarifying and
adjusting other rules, and integrating rules for Immortals.  It does 
not include the Mystara setting and cosmology elements.  The
monsters differ_ somewhat.

Delving Deeper
==============

`Delving Deeper` (`Delving Deeper Description`_, `Delving Deeper
PDFs`_) works very hard to be as faithful to the 3 Little Brown Books
of Original D&D (along with the relevant partsof Chainmail, with which
they were intended to be used) as possible.  The `Delving Deeper V4
Reference Rules Compendium`_ is a Print-on-Demand version of the three
booklets.  There is also the `Delving Deeper SRD`_.  I was
particularly interested in Version 5 of `Delving Deeper`, as that
promised annotated versions of the three booklets, but only one_ of the
annotated versions has been completed so far.
