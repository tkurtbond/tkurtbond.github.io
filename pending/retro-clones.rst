Retro-clones and neo-clones

Want a simple, clear, exceptionally well organized and presented
version of the classic B/X D&D rules?  `Old-School Essentials Classic
Fantasy`.

Want races separate from classes and the extra classes, races, and
many spells from AD&D 1E, all on the 1 to 14 level scale of B/X D&D?
`Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy`.

Want to play classic AD&D 1E modules with all races, classes, and most
spells from AD&D 1E, on a mostly 1 to 20 level scale, with 9\
:sup:`th` level magic user spells and 7\ :sup:`th` cleric spells?
`Labyrinth Lord: Revised` and `Advanced Edition Companion`, or
`Advanced Labyrinth Lord`.

Want something that feels like Original D&D, just before AD&D 1E came
out, with the classes and races and spells familiar from AD&D 1E, but
simpler, on a mostly 1 to 20+ level scale, with 9\ :sup:`th` level
magic user spells and 7\ :sup:`th` cleric spells?? `Swords & Wizardry
Complete`.

Like the 1 to 14 level scale and the lower hit dice of B/X D&D, but
want more detailed rules?  `Adventurer, Conqueror, King System`.

• `Basic Fantasy`_

  I *think* I looked at `Basic Fantasy`_ first, but it wasn't what I
  was looking for at the time.

  All its PDFs are free, and the print on demand books are *very*
  inexpensive.

  Although I notice that the character class tables all go to
  level 20.  I conjecture this is a residual artifact of the D&D 3E
  character classes going to level 20, since it doesn't match the B/X
  model that that is implied by the Basic Fantasy website with the
  statement “The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game
  system modeled on the classic RPG rules of the early 1980's.”
  Compare that to Labyrinth Lord's rescaling of B/X to match
  AD&D.

• `Labyrinth Lord Revised`_ & `Advanced Edition Companion`_

  While `Labyrinth Lord Revised` has been criticized for not being a
  completely faithful retro-clone of the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh
  Basic/Expert D&D rules (B/X), I think it still holds a useful spot.
  The changes that were made in the revised version of `Labyrinth
  Lord` made it easier to be used with `Advanced Edition Companion`
  (AEC).  It adapted the 1–14 level scale of B/X to the scale of AD&D
  1E, generally about 20 levels, and with AEC it added the separate
  races and the additional classes, spells, monsters, and magic items
  of AD&D 1E.

  (`No-art LL`_; `no-art AEC`_.)

  - `Advanced Labyrinth Lord`_

    This compiles the information from `Labyrinth Lord` and `Advanced
    Edition Companion` into one convenient book.

• `Swords & Wizardry`_

  Relatively faithful retro-clone of Original D&D and its supplements
  at a point just before AD&D 1E was introduced, so it includes the
  classes and many of the spells of AD&D 1E.

  If you are looking to play something with the feel of AD&D 1E,
  but want something even simpler than `Labyrinth Lord Revised`_ and
  `Advanced Edition Companion`_, this is an excellent choice.

• OSRIC_

  I looked at OSRIC, (a free `OSRIC PDF`_ is available, as well as a
  free PDF of the Usherwood_ Pocket_ version) but was more interested in
  Basic/Export retroclones at the time.  I think it is a well written,
  organized, and presented restatement of AD&D 1E.  The `Black Blade
  Publishing`_ print edition is a very nice offset printed, sewn
  spine, volume.  I just wish it wasn't missing some of the classes.
  (I miss the Monk in particular.)  I was also surprised by how many
  of the little quirks and restrictions of AD&D 1E have been ironed
  out, although many remain.

• `Dark Dungeons`_ (DDFreePDF_, DDHardback_, DDSoftcover_, DDDeluxe_)

  This is a retro-clone of The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.  With the RC
  available in PDF and Print-on-Demand, the urgency for this seems less.

  `Dark Dungeons` does have changes_ from the Rules Cyclopedia,
  integrating some optional rules, extrapolating, clarifying and
  adjusting other rules, and integrating rules for Immortals.  It does 
  not include the Mystara setting and cosmology elements.  The
  monsters differ_ somewhat.

  `Old School Essentials: Classic Fantasy` is the best organized and
  presented version of the classic rules from the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh
  Basic/Expert D&D sets.  This is the game that I wish had been around
  when I started playing.

  `Old School Essentials: Advanced Fantasy` is the best organized and
  presented version of the ideas of the classic rules from 1\
  :sup:`st` edition AD&D, scaled to match the 1–14 level scope of the
  Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D sets.  If I was starting a new
  D&D campaign these are the rules I'd use, all things being equal.

• `Adventure, Conqueror, King System`_ (ACKS)

  Liked B/X D&D's scale, but wanted more details?  ACKS is the game
  for you.
