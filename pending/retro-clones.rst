Retro-clones and neo-clones

• `Basic Fantasy`_

  I *think* I looked at `Basic Fantasy`_ first, but it wasn't what I
  was looking for at the time.

• `Labyrinth Lord`_ & `Advanced Edition Companion`_

  (`No-art LL`_; `no-art AEC`_.)

• OSRIC_

  I looked at OSRIC, (a free `OSRIC PDF`_ is available) but was more
  interested in Basic/Export retroclones at the time.  I think it is a
  well written, organized, and presented restatement of AD&D 1E.  The
  `Black Blade Publishing`_ print edition is a very nice offset
  printed, sewn spine, volume.  I just wish it wasn't missing some of
  the classes.  (I miss the Monk in particular.)  I was also surprised
  by how many of the little quirks and restrictions of AD&D 1E have
  been ironed out, although many remain.

• `Dark Dungeons`_

  This is a retro-clone of The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.  With the RC
  available in PDD, the urgency for this seems less.
