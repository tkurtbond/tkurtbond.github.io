Retro-clones and neo-clones
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Want a simple, clear, exceptionally well organized and presented
version of the classic B/X D&D rules?  `Old-School Essentials Classic
Fantasy`.

Want races separate from classes and the most of the extra classes,
races, and many spells from AD&D 1E, all on the 1 to 14 level scale of
B/X D&D?  `Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy`.

Want to play classic AD&D 1E modules with all races, classes, and most
spells from AD&D 1E, on a mostly 1 to 20 level scale, with 9\
:sup:`th` level magic user spells and 7\ :sup:`th` cleric spells?
`Labyrinth Lord: Revised` and `Advanced Edition Companion`, or
`Advanced Labyrinth Lord`.

Want something that feels like Original D&D, just before AD&D 1E came
out, with the classes and races (except for gnomes and illusionists)
and spells familiar from AD&D 1E, but simpler, on a mostly 1 to 20+
level scale, with 9\ :sup:`th` level magic user spells and 7\
:sup:`th` cleric spells?? `Swords & Wizardry Complete`.

Like the 1 to 14 level scale and the lower hit dice of B/X D&D, but
want more detailed rules, especially for domain play?  `Adventurer,
Conqueror, King System`.

Basic Fantasy
=============

I *think* I looked at `Basic Fantasy`_ first, but it wasn't what I
was looking for at the time.

All its PDFs are free, and the print on demand books are *very*
inexpensive.

Although I notice that the character class tables all go to
level 20.  I conjecture this is a residual artifact of the D&D 3E
character classes going to level 20, since it doesn't match the B/X
model that that is implied by the Basic Fantasy website with the
statement “The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game
system modeled on the classic RPG rules of the early 1980's.”
Compare that to Labyrinth Lord's rescaling of B/X to match
AD&D.

Labyrinth Lord
==============

Original Edition Characters
---------------------------

`Original Edition Characters` is a player's supplement for `Labyrinth
Lord` that provides characters more like those of Original D&D.
(OECPDF_, OECPOD_)

Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition & Advanced Edition Companion
------------------------------------------------------------

While `Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition`_ (LLRE; PDF and POD) has been
criticized for not being a completely faithful retro-clone of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D rules (B/X), I think it still
holds a useful spot.  The changes that were made in the revised
version of `Labyrinth Lord` made it easier to be used with `Advanced
Edition Companion`_ (AEC).  It adapted the 1–14 level scale of B/X to
the scale of AD&D 1E, generally about 20 levels, and with AEC it added
the separate races and the additional classes, spells, monsters, and
magic items of AD&D 1E.

There are versions of LLRE and AEC available for free: `No-art LLRE`_ and
`no-art AEC`_.

Advanced Labyrinth Lord
-----------------------

`Advanced Labyrinth Lord` compiles the information from `Labyrinth
Lord: Revised Edition` and `Advanced Edition Companion` into one
convenient book (ALL_, PDF and POD).

Swords & Wizardry Complete
--------------------------

If you are looking to play something with the feel of AD&D 1E,
but want something even simpler than `Labyrinth Lord: Revised Edition`_ and
`Advanced Edition Companion`_, this is an excellent choice, as long
as you don't need gnomes or illusionists.

OSRIC
=====

I looked at OSRIC_, (a free `OSRIC PDF`_ is available, as well as a
free PDF of the `Usherwood Publishing`_ `OSRIC Pocket SRD`_ version)
but was more interested in Basic/Export retroclones at the time.  I
think it is a well written, organized, and presented restatement of
AD&D 1E.  The `Black Blade Publishing`_ print edition is a very nice
offset printed, sewn spine, volume.  The `Usherwood Publishing`_
`OSRIC Pocket SRD`_ (PDF, POD) is quite affordable.  I just wish OSRIC
wasn't missing some of the classes.  (I miss the Monk in particular.)
I was also surprised by how many of the little quirks and restrictions
of AD&D 1E have been ironed out, although many remain.  `Usherwood
Publishing`_ has some supplements that add some of the missing
classes, though.

Dark Dungeons
=============

`Dark Dungeons` is available in a free PDF (DDFreePDF_), a hardback
(DDHardback_), a paperback (DDPaperback_), and a deluxe color edition
(DDDeluxe_).

This is a retro-clone of The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.

`Dark Dungeons` does have changes_ from the Rules Cyclopedia,
integrating some optional rules, extrapolating, clarifying and
adjusting other rules, and integrating rules for Immortals.  It does 
not include the Mystara setting and cosmology elements.  The
monsters differ_ somewhat.

Delving Deeper
==============

`Delving Deeper` (`Delving Deeper Description`_, `Delving Deeper
PDFs`_) works very hard to be as faithful to the 3 Little Brown Books
of Original D&D (along with the relevant partsof Chainmail, with which
they were intended to be used) as possible.  The `Delving Deeper V4
Reference Rules Compendium`_ is a Print-on-Demand version of the three
booklets.  There is also the `Delving Deeper SRD`_.  I was
particularly interested in Version 5 of `Delving Deeper`, as that
promised annotated versions of the three booklets, but only one of the
annotated versions has been completed so far.

Old School Essentials
=====================

`Old School Essentials` is published by `Necrotic Gnome`_ in two
flavors so far, `Classic Fantasy` and `Advanced Fantasy`.

.. _Necrotic Gnome: https://necroticgnome.com/


Old School Essentials Classic Fantasy
-------------------------------------

`Old School Essentials Classic Fantasy` (OSECF_) is the best organized
and presented version of the classic rules from the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh
Basic/Expert D&D sets.  This is the game that I wish had been around
when I started playing.  There is an SRD (OSESRD_).

.. _OSECF: https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-rules-tome
.. _OSESRD: https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/

Old School Essentials Advanced Fantasy
--------------------------------------

`Old School Essentials Advanced Fantasy` is the best organized and
presented version of the ideas of the classic rules from 1\
:sup:`st` edition AD&D, scaled to match the 1–14 level scope of the
Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert D&D sets.  If I was starting a new
D&D campaign these are the rules I'd use, all things being equal.

`Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy` is collected in the `Player's
Tome`_ and `Referee's Tome`_.

Adventure, Conqueror, King System (ACKS)
========================================

Liked B/X D&D's scale, but wanted more details?  ACKS is the game
for you.
