I finished reading the `Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy Rules
Tome` from cover to cover and I am very impressed.

As I say in my terse Goodreads review:

       My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4087725161">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
       Excellent restatement of the class Basic/Expert (B/X) rules from 1981. Exceptionally clear presentation in wording, typography, and layout. Excellent physical production quality. I liked the use of full page or 2 page spread color artwork, and the black and white art included on the other pages. Excellent range of artwork.

To expand on this:

I've said elsewhere_ that I started playing with AD&D.  As far as I
can remember, we often simplified things: we never used segments,
spell components, or Armor Class Adjustments, and I'm not sure we 
discharged missiles, magical device attacks, cast spells and turned
undead
