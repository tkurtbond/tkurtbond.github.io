<h2>OCaml and a Rare FreeBSD binary incompatibility</h2>
<p>In a rare fit of binary incompatibility between versions of FreeBSD,
all my OCaml 3.07p2 programs that used the Unix library broke when I
upgraded to 5.2 because gethostbyaddr_r disappeared:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ increment
Fatal error: cannot load shared library dllunix
Reason: /sw/versions/ocaml/3.07/lib/ocaml/stublibs/dllunix.so: Undefined symbol "gethostbyaddr_r"</pre>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2003-December/016677.html">this e-mail</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Reconfiguring and re-installing ocaml seems to have fixed the problem,
but once that was done I had to rebuild (almost) all my ocaml programs
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">unison</a>, the file
synchronization program that I use.</p>
<p>This is notable mainly because of how rarely this sort of thing
happens to either FreeBSD or OCaml.</p>
<p>Looks like some other things have broken, too: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>, for one.</p>
<p>I resolved all this by upgrading my ports using <code class="program docutils literal">portupgrade</code>.</p>

<li><p><em>Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle Earth</em>, by John
Garth; Houghton Miffllin, 2003.  This meticulous new biography of J.R.R.
Tolkien during the years of World War I lays the groundwork for
Garth's eloquent argument that Tolkien's fiction, rather than being an
escape from reality, is Tolkien's reflection on and reaction to his
experiences as a combatant in World War II. Despite its very
specialized nature it's quite interesting, and Garth argues
convincingly.  It its own specialized way, it is quite as good as Tom
Shippey's <a class="reference external" href="#the-road-to-middle-earth">The Road to Middle Earth</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#author-of-the-century">J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the

<h2>RPGs Need Campaigns</h2>
<p>I think that the most important supplement for a a newly introduced
roleplaying game setting (whether part of a dedicated RPG or as a
supplement for a generic RPG) is a campaign.  I'm thinking of things
like <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>'s <em>The Enemy Within</em> campaign, or
any of several <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> campaigns, or <em>Pendragon</em>'s <em>The Boy
King</em>.  You really need a good campaign to see extended examples of
what a setting can do.</p>

<p>I had to do some maintenance on the <code class="program docutils literal">FILETAP</code> program today.
I last worked on it in 1988, as far as I can tell.  The last time it
was compiled was in 1990 (going by the file dates) but I doubt that
anybody had changed the code since 1988 when I last worked on it.
It's written to use the POISE SPL API, the Support Procedure Library.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the only reason it needed recompiled now is that one
of MPL's POISE users finally found a use for field-and-record level
security and the enhanced security features only work if the program
is linked against the shared library (<code class="file docutils literal">.EXE</code>) and not the statically
linked library (<code class="file docutils literal">.OLB</code>).  And the program required no code changes to
get it to work.</p>
<p>So where's the maintenance? It turns out that there are actually two
version of this program, <code class="program docutils literal">TFILETAP</code> and <code class="program docutils literal">FILETAP</code>,
and it's not obvious <em>why</em> there are two versions.  <code class="program docutils literal">FILETAP</code>
is the version that appears to be used the most, but
<code class="program docutils literal">TFILETAP</code> is slightly different (mostly because it opens the
key file for exclusive access).  Unfortunately, as I've lamented
several times in the past, we weren't using any sort of revision
control back then, much less configuration control, so there is no
history of changes, much less an explicit reason for the changes.  Oh
well.  I guess I'll have to look at it some more later.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>The Death of the Necromancer</em>, by Martha Wells; Avon, 1998.  I've
read two of her other books (<a class="reference external" href="posts/2003/12/15/2003-12-15/#wells-wizard-hunters">Wizard Hunters</a> and <a class="reference external" href="posts/2003/12/21/2003-12-21/#wells-element-of-fire">The
Element of Fire</a>) and this one, like the others, is very good.  The setting is
Ile-Rein again, but this time in a more psuedo-Victorian era, nicely
adapted to the mostly subtle magic of Ile-Rein.  I highly recommend
these books, and am going to look for more of her work.  (There is at
least one of hers that I have not read yet: <em>City of Bones</em>.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sorcerer: An Intense Roleplaying Game</em>, by Ron Edwards; Adept
Press, 2001.  This small, slim hardback volume (260mm by 175mm, 144
pages, counting the two pages of ads at the back) is the core rulebook
for Edwards roleplaying game, <em>Sorcerer</em>.  It has a crisp, clean black-
and-white interior design and layout by Paul Mason with a modicum of
black-and-white art by divers hands and a color jacket cover with
creepy and effective art by Jeff Kromer.  The writing is casual but not
chatty and very clear.  It can be ordered directly from the game's home
page, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/">http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/</a>
or bought at a good local games store.  Most existing roleplaying games
give a lot of attention to the rules of the game and some give a lot
of attention to the setting of the game and a few give some attention
to the atmosphere of the game, but few give much attention to the
purpose of the game and how the setting and the rules contribute to
the purpose, and this lack of attention can be a considerable source
of dissatisfaction with the game, the gaming group, and the rules of
the game.  Ron Edwards' essay "System Does Matter", published <a class="reference external" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/11/">on the
web</a> and as an appendix in
<em>Sorcerer</em>, gives the gamer some good tools for considering what they
want out of a roleplaying game and judging whether a particular set of
rules will help them achieve that, and anyone who is interested in
roleplaying games should read it: it's probably one of the simpliest
coherent places to start if you are interested in the theory of
roleplaying.  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2004/01/04/2004-01-04/#id2" id="id1">1</a> In <em>Sorcerer</em> Ron Edwards takes the theory that
begins with that article and applies it (along with his ideals of
creator-ownership of roleplaying games) and produces an innovative,
focused roleplaying game with simple, clear rules that encourage
flexibility and creativity while discarding many of the traditional
trappings and constaints of roleplaying games.  <em>Sorcerer</em> does this by
concentrating on <em>Narrativist</em> play, where the desired outcome of a
roleplaying session is a good story.  This does not mean forcing the
players along some pre-determined story, however; instead, <em>Sorcerer</em>
concentrates on techniques for designing characters, adventures, and
campaigns and tools for running games in such a way that good stories
result from actual play.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</em>, by Ron Edwards; Adept Press, 2001.  In this first
supplement for <em>Sorcerer</em> Ron Edwards adapts his roleplaying game for
playing games based on 1920s and 30s pulp fantasy and its inheritors:
the <em>Conan</em> stories of Robert E. Howard, the <em>Fafhrd and the Grey
Mouser</em> stories of Fritz Leiber, the <em>Elric</em> stories of Michael
Moorcock, the <em>Kane</em> stories of Karl Edward Wagner, and many
others.  Like the original game, <em>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</em> is a practical
application of Ron Edwards' theory of roleplaying; in this case, to
providing the tools for a gaming group to create their own sword and
sorcery epic.  In many ways it runs counter to most roleplaying games,
eschewing complicated worldbuilding before play in favor of creating a
world through play.</p></li>

<p>There's a great deal of insightful, worthwhile writing on the
theory of roleplaying in the archives of the newsgroup
<a class="reference external" href="news://rec.games.frp.advocacy/">rec.games.frp.advocacy</a>, but it
can be very difficult to excavate.</p>
