<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>C.A.H. contributed the (lightly formatted) actual play report for this
session.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Actual Play</h3>
<p>After an extensive recap of what their previous adventures had
been 8 months earlier, the party set out to make their fortune by
any and all ways (at least the mostly legal ways).  The overall
plan was to sail north from port to port, making enough profit as
a merchant to keep themselves fed, and hopefully purchase a
salvage license before heading to the Whip Islands where vast
wealth can be found.</p>
<p>But first we had to await boat repairs in Swindon.  Moorumah
decided it was best to wait in the shade, or perhaps underwater,
so she set out to find the "shadiest dive" she could.  While she
found shade there, there was no swimming, only beer.  There was
also apparently no arm wrestling allowed.  Disappointed, she left
the bar, but shortly afterwards a young Doreen girl challenged her
to a wrestling match for the contents of her purse.
Unsuprisingly, the Doreen was no match for a Grael.  Defeated, the
Doreen ran off to the docks and disappeared into the water
(apparently she enjoyed dives, even if they are not shady).
Azrulektos decided that he would like to help the Doreen
out. After a few rounds of catch with Moorumah's net, he hid by
the docks to wait for her to emerge from the water.  When she
eventually emerged, he presented her an employment opportunity
(and decided that using a fishing net was perhaps not the best
recruitment tool when seeking crew). We learned the Doreen's name
is Trix. We took her on as a lookout.</p>
<p>A few days later we topped off our provisions ($56) and finally
set sail.  Karl and Azrulektos worked out a merchant plan to
maximize profit while sailing up the coast.  Our first destination
was the fishing village of Bristo where we planned to take on food
cargo.  However, 1 day out, our new lookout proved profitable when
she spotted a possible ruin 80 yards down.  We stopped, and set up
a diving operation with Azrulektos, Moorumah, Karl, Trix, and
Mongrel.  Eight hours later we had found $625 in coins and
treasure, and decided to keep working.  This proved to be a good
decision, as we found a mansion containing lots of loot -- $5625
and a sealed vial containing a yellow liquid.  Miguel continued to
display hidden talents, and directed us to the ship's hidey hole
to store our newfound wealth. We continued on to Bristo without
further incident.</p>
<p>In Bristo we had no difficulty finding and securing 4 cargo spaces
worth of food from the harbor master Thomas Crane for $440.  We
did not stay over, as there was nothing much to do (other than
clean up Moorumah's rat hunting), and the crew was eager to get to
a large port (Baltimus) to spend their earnings (our first big
profit since our original shipwreck nearly a month ago). However
it was not to be an uneventful trip.</p>
<p>Three days out we cleared a fog bank to find ourselves on the
scene of a very recent act of piracy.  Indeed the pirates had not
yet vacated the area, as they seemed to be engaging in a drunken
revelry over their recent profit. Moorumah followed her usual
course upon encountering a battle scene and cannon-balled into
water and began to swim to the nearest boat.  The pirates were so
engaged in their festivities that they failed to notice her, or
even our ship (until it was too late).  We loaded the cannon with
grapeshot, and "crossed the T", killing nearly half of them
outright.  We then pulled along side them and prepared to board,
while Moorumah climbed up from the other side.  Partying pirates
were no match for a partying Grael, who began pulverising them one
by one, howling with victory after each kill. Azrulektos's water
bolts and Karl's pistols and rapier were equally deadly, and the
combat was over in three rounds.</p>
<p>We now find ourselves in possession of a black sloop, 4 storage units
of iron, $1700, and a whole lot of guns.  As well as two seriously
injured victims of the pirates (whom we healed to the best of our
abilities).  We decide the best course of action is to leave half the
guns and money (kept $800) on the pirate ship to reduce suspicion of
looting, and sail it behind our own boat into Baltimus.  Just out of
site of the port Azrulektos hides our salvaged goods in a chest
underwater.  Upon arriving in port, we are greeted by many soldiers
and cannon, who are suspicious of the known pirate vessel (The Black
Falcon).  We convince them we are not pirates and that we have killed
the pirate captain Patrick Triloni <strong>[Patrik Trelawany, to be precise
— GM]</strong> (Moorumah helpfully displays his corpse).  We express interest
in aquiring a Letter of Marque, and also in upgrading from our boat to
the captured boat.  The harbormaster tells us there are some legal
issues to work out, and it will take a few days, we decide we will use
the time to take a cargo of Goods up to Calib's Rock, and then return
with another load of Food.  But first we sell our current load for
$1200, pay the crew their long awaited wages of $350, buy a salvage
license for $1000, a compass for $500, and spend $70 restocking our
rations.  As well as some time and money carousing.</p>

<h3>Privateers</h3>
<p>When the PCs brought in their capture, I wasn't sure how to handle it.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html">50 Fathoms</a> rules, on p. 35, essentially say that privateers must first
buy a letter of marque for $15,000, and then they get a <strong>25%</strong> bounty
on captured ships.  That commission is much, much lower than typical
historical amounts.  Moreover, if someone captures a pirate ship
without a letter of marque they get a token bounty of <strong>10%</strong>.  I
decided that I'd look into the historical values, and decide what to
do before the next session, and in the meantime the authorities told
the PCs there were some legal details to work out.</p>
<div class="section" id="c-a-h-s-research">
<h4>C.A.H.'s Research</h4>
<p>C.A.H found the following online, in the paper
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.org/pdf/working_papers/41_privateering.pdf">Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit</a>,
by Larry J. Sechrest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the ship was declared a “lawful prize”, the court issued the
decree of condemnation, and she and her cargo would be sold at
auction. However, the gross proceeds from that sale were not received
by the privateer. Three deductions first had to be made. As payment
for their services, small percentages went to the auctioneer, the
marshal, and the clerk of the court. A further, much larger deduction
was also necessary. Since the goods that made up the prize’s cargo now
represented “imports”, customs duties were imposed. Although the
magnitude of these duties varied with the nature of the goods, Garitee
estimates that during the War of 1812 such taxes usually reduced the
revenue accruing to American privateers by 30-40%.  The owners of
privateers protested so angrily against these high duties that, in
August of 1813, Congress reduced the taxes on “imported” prize goods
by one-third.</p>
<p>British and American prize courts operated in very similar ways even
after the American Revolutionary War. And yet, during the earlier
period of letter of marque activity, British privateers---including of
course those outfitted in Britain’s American colonies---were
confronted with deductions from the gross prize proceeds that included
not only court costs and import duties but also a share for the
crown. This share varied from one-half to one-tenth. Due to the
growing economic importance and political influence of privateers, the
crown’s share was gradually reduced and, in 1708, eliminated
altogether.  As a result, privateer profits increased by as much as
30%.</p>

<p>So, with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html">50 Fathoms</a> rules, the sloop and its cargo are worth $23,200,
but the bounty for someone without a letter of marque is only $2,320,
and if they get the letter of marque it leaves them in the hole by
$12,680.</p>
<!-- (let* ((total   (+ 20000 (* 4 800)))

<p>I was originally tempted to go with something closer to the real-world
values: say, 1% fee for selling the ship and cargo, and a 25% tax on
the value of the seized ship and cargo.  That would mean that the
sloop and cargo would net the PCs $17,168, minus $15,000 for the
letter of marque, leaving the PCs with $2,168.</p>
<p>On the other hand, handing over this much money to the PCs might make
the trade economy in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html">50 Fathoms</a> go crazy.</p>

discussion on pages 70 and 207, a letter of marque costs $1,000 and
privateers must pay 50% of their spoils to the crown.  That means that
the sloop and cargo, minus the cost of the letter of marque, would
leave the PCs with a net of $10,600.  Ouch.  That seems too much.</p>
</div>

<p>If we combine the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html">50 Fathoms</a> letter of marque cost of $15,000 with the
<cite>PotSM</cite> bounty of 50%, that leaves the PCs owing the Baltimus

<p>But it's not that simple.  The PCs want to <em>keep</em> the sloop they
captured, and <em>sell</em> the skiff they have.</p>
<!-- (let* ((sloop   20000)
       (cargo   (* 4 800))
       (skiff   10000)
       (skiff+  (+ skiff cargo))
       (tax     (* (+ sloop cargo) .50))
       (net     (- skiff+ tax))
       (license (- net 15000)))
  `(sloop: ,sloop tax: ,tax skiff+: ,skiff+ net: ,net license: ,license))
  ; (sloop: 20000 tax: 11600.0 skiff+: 13200 net: 1600.0 license: -13400.0) -->
<p>If the authorities let them substitute the skiff for the sloop they'd
still have to pay the whole tax on the sloop and the cargo, $11,600,
and they'd have only the sale price of the skiff and the cargo,
$13,200, and they'd still have to pay for the license, which would
leave them owing the authorities $13,000.</p>

<h5>After E-mail</h5>
<p>In the end, the e-mail discussion lead the players to choose Option 3.</p>
<p>As was mentioned in the e-mail discussion, there wasn't a specific
bounty for Patrick Trelawany.</p>
<p>C.A.H. said: “We left $4800 worth of firearms + $900 in cash on the sloop”.
Ok, the PCs get 50% of the cash, $450, and 25% of the firearms, $1200.</p>

<p>Today I got my copy of James Raggi's <cite>The Random Esoteric Creature
Generator</cite>, published by Goodman Games.  In general I like it.
However, I do have two criticisms.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, and most important, to the publishers: black text on a gray
background with white lines is <strong>much</strong> harder to read than black
text on a white background with black lines  <strong>Please, please, please,
don't do this.  It doesn't make your book look any better, and it
just irritates anybody with less than absolutely perfect vision!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Second, to the author: In the Basic Body Shape table, on pages 6
through 7, in the Polyhedron sub-table you missed the obvious: the
<strong>Icosahedron</strong> shape should occur on a roll of 20.</p></li>

<h2>Actual Play</h2>
<p><strong>1st day:</strong> They found the crypt doors locked again.  Pick Locks
failed, so they went back to the Temple.  Hermes: Red Stone. James:
Key, so /bite (he immediately dropped the key, so was only bitten
once), then Blue Stone.  Zedd: Gray Stone. John: Key, so Bite (and
dropped the key).  Arlow: Gold Stone.  Elsie: Green Stone.  Grimmin:
Key.  Since some were injured they went back to Mad Sammy's, go
thealed, and slept.</p>
<p><strong>2nd day:</strong>  Back to crypt.  Door in room <strong>2</strong> was locked again and
when they opened it they surprised 8 giant rats.  R1 rats surprised,
Leanna and Grimmin step forward and attack, killing 3 rats, while the
rest of the party falls back and takes position in room <strong>2</strong>.  R2
Hermes casts <em>sleep</em>, sending the remaining 5 rats off to their last
slumber, then the rest of the party coup-de-graced the rats.  They
decided to pick them up on the way back out to smoke-dry for rations.
Off to area <strong>4</strong>, the pit.  Wandering Monster: 4 skeletons in the
pit.  They animate when James starts down into the pit.  John turns 5
HD, so all the skeletons tried to flee over the north edge of the pit,
which repeatedly dumps them back into the pit.  It takes the party 6
rounds to destroy the skeletons, but James took 4 wounds and fell
unconscious. Zedd had the Green Rod Key.  He put it in the
green-daubed hole and pulls upward.  Everybody hears the click.  He
takes the key out.  The party members in the pit climb out on the
north side, which now <em>doesn't</em> dump them back in the pit, and the
rest of the party steps around the corner from the west site of the
pit.  Leanna picks up James and carries him, and they all head off to
the door to room <strong>11</strong>.</p>
<!-- Wandering Monster: Dwarf, 3 HD, Reaction Roll 9, Hostile. -->
<p>They had reached the doors when they noticed, coming up the hallway
behind them, a rather surly looking dwarf.  After an exchange where
the dwarf insisted they shouldn't be here and tried to intimidate them
into leaving, he turned and left.  T.A. immediately has Arlow (?)
agitating for the party to attack the retreating dwarf.  Upon learning
that the dwarf is wearing plate mail, Grimmin and Leanna fire their
crossbows at the dwarf, and Arlow joins in.  They score one hit, but
the dwarf steps round the corner over the pit, and Arlow, Grimmin, and
Leanna chase after him.  They chase him in the dark until he vanishes
out of their range of sight at the bottom of the stairs in room
<strong>10</strong>.  They hesitate at the top of the stairs, Leanna retreating to
find the others, and Grimmin and Arlow hear a scream in the room
below, then sounds of struggle, then silence.  They wait, listening,
and then Grimmin is surprised by the shadow and taken to –1 HP in the
first attack.  Arlow picks up Grimmin and flees to room <strong>2</strong>, where
they paused.  The others (carrying James) are already in room <strong>2</strong>.
Here they are all surprised again when <em>2</em> shadows attack!  The
shadows attacked Arlow (and missed) and Zedd (and hit).  In the second
round the shadows attacked Hermes (and missed) and Leanna (and hit).
Party fled and left crypt door open.</p>
<p>They spent two days just resting and healing.  Every night they had
wolves howling outside and clawing at the Mad Sammy's cellar door.
Mad Sammy shrieked and howled, babbling that they had offended “the
eye”.  On the third day some of them hunted, because their supplies
were gone and Mad Sammy's supplies were running low.  They found
enough to feed four people for the day.  On the fourth day they found
enough food to feed three people for the day.  On the fifth day John
was able to heal Leanna of the last of her wounds, and the party was
finally completely healed.  On the sixth day they found enough rations
for 12 people, and after eating had 3 days rations to smoke dry that
evening.</p>
<p>On the seventh day they headed back to the crypt.  They went directly
to room <strong>11</strong>, where they were surprised by 2 ghouls hidden in the
loose dirt near a ¾ buried chest.  Grimmin was paralyzed on the first
round (for 7 rounds), but the rest of the party was able to kill the
ghouls in three more rounds.  John cast <em>cure light wounds</em> on
Grimmin, which also cured his paralysis.  Leanna took the magic flail,
and Hermes took both scrolls.  Back to mad Sam's, where there were
still wolves at the door every night.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I made an effort this time to follow the <cite>Labyrinth Lord</cite> Labyrinth
Play Sequence, Time and Movement, Rest, Monster Reaction, Wandering
Monsters, and Morale Checks rules more closely than I have
hitherto.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2010/09/05/brigand-crypt-part-3/#back-in-the-day" id="id1">1</a> The dwarf was a wandering monster roll,
straight from the Level 1 column on the Wandering Monster Table on
p. 104 of <cite>Labyrinth Lord</cite>, with everything after that improvised on
the fly — I decided he was another treasure hunter, upset at finding
competition, and once he started to flee the PCs it seemed inevitable
that he end up in the room with the shadow, and get killed and turned
into a shadow himself. I thought it added a lot to the game, and made
me look on wandering monsters with much more approval.  I do think
that I ought to make location-specific wandering monster tables,
though.</p>

</div>
<p>T.A., E.A., and M.A. had created characters earlier, but D.B. had to
create characters before we started.</p>
<div class="section" id="attending">
<h2>Attending</h2>
<p>Clockwise round the table:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.K.B. — Labyrinth Lord</p></li>
<li><p>C.DW. — a Thief named Aria</p></li>
<li><p>B.B. — a Dwarf named Urgo</p></li>
<li><p>T.A. — a Magic User named Octavian</p></li>
<li><p>E.A. — an Elf named Trista</p></li>
<li><p>M.A. — a Cleric named Jude</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They trekked through the hills for 4 days (Trista downing a dear when
their rations were gone), until they finally found the huge tree said
to be the entrance to the old pit.  Unfortunately, they were unable to
find the entrance, and as they were looking they were attacked by
javelins thrown from above, in the tree.  Not able to see their
assailants in the leafy boughs, they fled.  At a safe distance they
decided to run back and have the dwarf climb the tree, while the elf,
thief, and cleric used their missile weapons.  With the goblins
concentrating on the dwarf climbing towards them, the others were
finally able to pinpoint the goblins, and managed to kill one of them,
by the time the heavily wounded dwarf managed to climb up to the
goblins and miss his first attack.  The dwarf managed to scare the
remaining goblin into surrendering, and they climbed down out of the
tree.  The goblin swore he would leave and go back to the deep
mountains, if they would let him go.  When the dwarf swore he would
let him go if the goblin told them how to enter the pit, the goblin
did so.  An argument ensued among the PCs, Octavian in particular not
wanting to let the goblin go, but Urgo finally did (having sworn) and
the goblin high-tailed it out of there.  Several of the PCs had been
injured, but Urgo had taken the worst of the damage while climbing up
the tree.</p>
<p>They headed down the narrow dirt tunnel the goblin had shown them,
concealed behind a cleverly hinged section of a huge root, and the
tunnel quickly opened up into a stairway cut from stone.  They passed
through one empty room, where they paused to light Octavian's lantern,
then down another stair to a much larger room.  At the far side of the
room they could just make out a demonic face carved on the wall, its
huge mouth gaping blackly.  As they stared at the demonic face they
were surprised by 4 goblins springing down from niches high on the
wall where the stairway entered, behind them.  After a few rounds,
they were attacked by archers in the dark beyond the demonic mouth,
too. Soon all the PCs were badly injured, the dwarf at 0 HP, Octavian
at negative HP, and then Aria was brought to negative HP.  Urgo bound
Aria's wounds, and fell unconscious himself, bleeding to death, while
Trista and Jade attacked the two goblins beyond the mouth, Jade
throwing himself through the gaping mouth.  Jude killed one of the two
goblin archers, but fell to the other, who finally fled in the face of
Trista's deadly arrows.  This left Trista the only conscious
adventurer, with four unconscious companions to care for in this
deadly dungeon.</p>
<p>She bound up her comrades' wounds, then searched the dead goblins,
finding a single vial of thick green liquid.  She gave it to the
dwarf, Urgo, and when he revived they carried their comrades partway
back up the winding stairs, out of easy bowshot, and secured them to
iron spikes, so they wouldn't slip down the steps.  There they each
guarded one approach.  Urgo fell asleep, but luckily Trista's keen
elvish senses noticed his snores and woke him, for in the night he
heard goblins approaching up the stair.  He hurtled himself down the
stair into the 4 goblins, killing one outright and injuring another
and setting them and himself tumbling to the bottom of the stairs.
Dazed and confused by the tumble, they all traded blows in the dark,
flailing madly and futilely until Urgo finally killed 2 more of them,
and the last remaining goblin fled back through the mouth before Urgo
could catch up with him.</p>
<p>Eventually Jude recovered from his wounds enough to wake and pray, and
then healed Aria.  The companions then fled, carrying the unconscious
and deeply wounded Octavian with them, headed for town!</p>

<p>The characters from <a class="reference external" href="posts/2010/08/07/brigand-crypt-part-2/brigand-crypt-part-1.html">part 1</a> spent several days healing and resting.
Some friends who'd had the same idea about finding the brigands'
treasure showed up (M.A.'s Zedd and E.A's Leanna) and were welcomed to
the party.  Zedd brought his pony, who sleeps with them in Mad Sammy's
cellar at night.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For some reason I think the first fight in the sarcophagus
happened right after the fight with the ghouls, but my notes say
it happened in the second session.  I'll put it both places for
now.</p>
</div>
<p>They went back to room <strong>6</strong>, and decided to open one of the closed
stone coffins, and while pushing the heavy lid off, Elsie, along with
several others, fell into the coffin on top of the skeleton.  The
others managed to (eventually) exit the coffin, but poor Elsie was too
entangled with the skeleton.  Eventually the party killed the
skeleton, but Elsie ended in the negative hit points, so
they went back to Mad Sammy's with Elsie on a floating disk to
recover.</p>
<p>After healing up, they went back to room <strong>6</strong> and opened coffin #2,
where a couple fell in again, but got pulled out more quickly.  They
killed the skeleton and opened the rest of the coffins and found the
treasure and a key.  They move through room <strong>7</strong>, empty since its
occupants were killed in room <strong>6</strong> in the first session, and enter
room <strong>8</strong>, where the piercers drop, impaling Zedd &amp; Leanna &amp; missing
Arlow.  They eventually pull the piercers out (doing more damage in
the process, and kill the piercers.  Then it was back to Mad Sammy's
to rest again.</p>
<p>When they returned to the crypt they entered room <strong>9</strong> where they
pulled down the hanging bodies and were attacked by the 2 blue cave
spiders.  John is bit and paralyzed, but the others kill the spiders.
John recovers from the paralysis in 6 rounds, and makes his save
vs. poison, so lives.  (Maybe here is when they went back to Sam's,
instead, or also?)  Next they're down the stairs to room <strong>10</strong>.  John
puts the key in first, gets bit, and tries to bash the statue with his
flail, and gets bit again.  Finally he drops the key, which rolls to
the floor after the statue releases John's arm.  Next they put the
stones in: Elsie the green (one of her weapons glows), Arlow the gray
(and he gets gray hair), James the gold (he gets a ring from the
statute, which Zedd puts on then returns to James, who puts it in the
statue's mouth, whereupon it falls out again), Grimmin the red (stung
for 1 HP of damage), Hermes the blue (he made his save), and then
Elsie put the key in.  They heard the chain beyond the wall, and got
the Green Rod Key, and then were attacked by the shadow.  By the time
they got it off Elsie, she was in the negatives, and by the time they
got it off Leanna (injuring her with their non-magical weapons in the
process and figuring out they could only injure the shadow the magic)
she was in the negatives took, so they grabbed the girls and fled,
leaving the shadow.  Each time the shadow attacked from the shadows
and the party was surprised.  Of course, they ran back to Mad Sam's,
although they did close the crypt doors on the way out.</p>
