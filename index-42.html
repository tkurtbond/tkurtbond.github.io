<p>For some odd reason I decided to power on my old Gateway 2000 486DX/33
and do something with it.  It hadn't been on since Wednesday, May
25th, 2005, if I can believe the BIOS date.  (I was pleasantly
surprised the settings hadn't gotten corrupted.)  Up to the point I turned it
off it was acting as a mail server backup for my personal system, and
was running Sendmail, Dovecot, a greylisting milter, and Emacs.  A
little before that it had actually been one of the MPL DNS servers.</p>
<p>Anyway, it had Windows 95 on the original 200MB IDE hard drive and
FreeBSD 4.10 on the 2GB Quantum XP32275S Atlas II.  It came with
Windows 95 of course when I bought it, but I ran <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">SLS Linux</a> on it
originally, if I remember correctly, because 386BSD wouldn't install,
and later <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCC_Interim_Linux">MCC Interim Linux</a>, and eventually <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  When my wife got
me the SCSI controler and CD-ROM I was so thrilled because now I
wouldn't get dragging home OS distributions on floppy any more!  Once
I got the 2GB hard drive I put Windows 95 back on the 200MB drive for
my wife and for the occastional work-related Windows 95 excursion.  It
had 16MB originally, but I scrounged 4MB more of RAM for it very late
on, when it was a DNS server.</p>
<p>I wanted to get a more recent OS on it, but remembering how FreeBSD
4.10 was a pretty tight fight there at the end, I decided I'd put
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> on it.  (NetBSD documentation says it still should be possible to
run in 4MB.)   I used NetBSD for a while for my main box at home, but
I was never satisfied that I'd mastered it as well as FreeBSD, and I
thought this would be good way to put the old 486 to work.  Luckily I
was albe to find an 3c509B card to get it on the network, because it
turned out the 3.5” floppy and the CD-ROM drive were both
non-functional.  (As I worked with the machine I remembered the floppy
had been bad when I'd turned it off, but the CD-ROM had been working.)
I gathered some confirmation information and then started trying to
figure out how I was going to get NetBSD on it.  Luckily the FreeBSD
4.10 install was still working and I was able to extract the NetBSD
dosboot.com bootloader  from base.tgz, copy it and the netbsd-install
kernel over the network with FreeBSD, mount the
old 200MB Windows 95/MS-DOS disk under FreeBSD, and copy the files
over there, then boot into MS-DOS with F8 when Windows 95 started to
boot, run through the prompting for each line in the config files and
answering “NO”, and then run <code class="docutils literal">dosboot <span class="pre">netbsd-install</span></code>.</p>
<p>The installation was successful, but unfortunately the boot process failed.</p>
<p>As I recall, I've had problems in the past getting boot loaders to
boot off this drive.  I'll have to revisit it when I have some more
time.</p>

<p>Well, it looks like a leader is slowly emerging in my quest for an
Emacs based mail reader: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gohome.org/wl/">Wanderlust</a></p>
<p>It handles MH- and Maildir-format mailboxes, UTF-8 in headers, has
good facilities for reading and composing MIME messages, and I finally
got it to work with Lotus Domino/Notes IMAP/SSL, amazingly.</p>
<p>Moreover, it looks like I'm probably going to switch to using a
Maildir-format mailbox, which will work well with my use of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a>:
MH-format mailboxes' use of plain numbers for message IDs/filenames
(which can change a lot) makes things a little more confusing when
syncing mailboxes with Unison.</p>
<p>Moving away from MH-format mailboxes is a bit of a shame, since it
means that I'll be losing the ability to use the MH command line
programs for accessing my e-mail.  I've used MH in the past, and have
always liked the command line access it gives you.  Ah well.  I wish
mdmh had advanced further.</p>

<p>I'm still having my personal e-mail crisis.</p>
<p>I said, <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/08/05/e-mail-crisis/">earlier</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, I've finally come up with a way to switch back and forth
between Gnus, Mew, and MH-E while keeping up with my current
e-mail[…].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was a bit premature.  What I should have said was that I'd found
a way to make sure I didn't lose any e-mail permanently when switching
back and fourth between e-mail clients.  I'm using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">maildrop</a> to copy
my incoming mail to the normal mail spool file and to a separate
archive mail file for each day. So, for instance, all the mail I got
on 2008/09/05 is archived in the mbox-format file
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Inboxes/2008-09-05.inbox</span></code>.</p>
<p>I also said, <a class="reference external" href="posts/2008/08/05/e-mail-crisis/">earlier</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gohome.org/wl/">Wanderlust</a> seems moribund.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that Wanderlust only <em>seems</em> moribund, especially to those
who only speak English.  If you check the mailing lists there's still
some activity, and if you poke around on the Wanderlust site you can
<a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.jpl.org/wl/snapshots/">find</a> a newer snapshot.  Unfortunately, Wanderlust uses several other
libraries (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/elisp/APEL/">APEL</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/elisp/FLIM/index.html.ja.iso-2022-jp">FLIM</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/elisp/SEMI/index.html.ja.iso-2022-jp">SEMI</a>) and these are also hard to find
much information about if you only speak English.  So I've been
fiddling around with it, and have figured out enough to get it working
for me.  (Thank goodness for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html">ports</a> system.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough, although Wanderlust mostly understands MH-format
mailboxes, there seems to be no built-in way to get it to read mail
out of a standard mbox-format spool file and into your inbox.  I guess
the assumption is that if you're not using IMAP then you've probably
moved on to using a maildir-format spool file, since they're supposed
to be more reliable.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not.  I'm trying to compare Wanderlust, <a class="reference external" href="http://mh-e.sourceforge.net/">MH-E</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mew.org/">Mew</a>, and
MH-E doesn't understand maildir-format mailboxes, so I have to stick
to mbox-format.  (Ok, I suppose I could mung things so MH-E uses Mew's
<code class="docutils literal">incm</code> to read the spool file.)</p>
<p>Moreover, I've got a fairly odd pattern of e-mail folders.  For years
in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nongnu.org/viewmail/">VM</a> I've saved my e-mail in in separate folders with names like
<code class="docutils literal">2008/08/users.bond_tk</code> or <code class="docutils literal">2008/08/list.clisp</code>, with VM
defaulting the folder names automatically.  I think I've mostly
figured out how to do this in MH-E, Mew, and Wanderlust, and I've
mostly figured out how to get the three of them to coexist peacefully,
so I can really give them a good comparison.  We'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Like many Emacs subsystems, the Emacs e-mail clients tend to use modes
with single-character commands for many things, and most the commands
are just regular keys, not key combinations.  I've gotten so used to
this that I find using e-mail clients that require mousing to be
extremely painful.  Moreover, I've become very accustomed to being
able to customize my e-mail client extensively using Lisp.</p>
<p>What it all boils down to is that I'm not happy unless my e-mail
client is part of Emacs.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://la.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/currentsite/tool/topcased.html">TOPCASED</a> pages I ran across an interesting <a class="reference external" href="http://la.sei.cmu.edu/aadlinfosite/LinkedDocuments/d2_1500_topcased.pdf">presentation</a> about
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.topcased.org/">TOPCASED</a>, which at the beginning basically says that with the
lifetime of aerospace products running as long as 10 to 30 years no
company is able to commit to supporting a development tool for such a
long time at an acceptable cost. (I think this was essentially
explaining their motivation for developing TOPCASED as an open source
project, though it's not quite explicitly stated.)</p>
<p>I find this very interesting, since I've worked on a number of
projects that, although not in the aerospace arena, have had lifetimes
vastly exceeding the expectations of anybody involved on the project.
While some of the original design and development tools are still
available, some are not, and replacing them, or in some cases just
using the ones that are still available, can be a complicated
business.  For small projects, collecting all the tools under CM so as
to be able rebuild any version of the project with the original tools
can be prohibitively expensive when commercial software is involved.
The idea of using open source tools because those will still be
available in 20 or 30 years and can be supported in a cost-effective
way seems reasonable, so it's interesting to see that there are a
number of open source projects of this nature in aerospace, an arena
known for mission critical systems.</p>

check.)  It's interesting to see how varied the “Taltos” novels are,
despite mostly having one main character, how consistent the voice
of the “Khaavren Romances” is, and how different from the others
<cite>Brokedown Palace</cite> is.  If I ever get my library out of boxes I
really need to reread all his other books.</p>
<p>The “Vlad Taltos” books are good individually, but even better as a
whole, much like Kenneth Bulmer's “Dray Prescot” books, which I only
really began to appreciate once I had the whole run and could read
them in sequence.</p>
