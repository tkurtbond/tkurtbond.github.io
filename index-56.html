<p>S, W to SW, S, SE, S, SE, NE, NW, around CH, N, NW, SW, slid down the greased
steps and all fell in northmost <strong>O</strong> (Oubliette).  I said that
Caramel's 10 foot pole fell across the entrance to the oubliette, so
they were able to throw Angrim's grappling hook up and snag it and
climb back out.</p>
<p>Back up the greased steps, and then NE to northmost <strong>G</strong>, where they
killed 4 gray goblins.  9 sp, 14 sp, 3 sp, 11 sp, 4 scale armor, 2
light crossbows, 4 flails.  Caramel took one light crossbow.</p>
<p>Went back to village.  With last time's haul they have 8 scale armor
(260 gp), 4 maces (10 gp), 4 flails (6 gp), 3 light crossbows (24
gp).  Total: 300 gp, 100 gp each.  Spent 2 weeks at village.</p>
<p>Back to the Gray Goblin Warrens.  S, W to SW, S, SE, S, SW, first
covered pit.  Angrim fell in.  Used Caramel's 12 iron spikes to get
around turn to where Angrim could climb up.</p>

    <p>Today, while visiting a local used book store, I was thrilled to find
a copy of the first edition of <cite>DragonQuest</cite>.  I played DragonQuest
extensively, but I'd never seen a copy of the 1st edition, and to find

<p>I really enjoyed this mix of faerie an Elizabethan England.
Interestingly, this novel was inspired by part of a campaign of the
<cite>Changeling</cite> RPG, which was one of the things talked about in the
informative “Extras” section of the book, where she recommends three
books by the folklorist Katherine Briggs: two on general British
faerie lore (<cite>British Folk-Tales and Legends</cite> and <cite>The Faeries in
Tradition and Literature</cite>) and one specifically about Shakespeare's
time (<cite>The Anatomy of Puck</cite>).  I'll have to look for those, and for
Maire Brennan's other books.  She has a <cite>website

<section id="attending"><h4>Attending</h4>
<p>Clockwise round the table, starting with the DM at 6 o'clock:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>P.D.F. as DM</p></li>
<li><p>T.K.B. playing Droston a'Seamus</p></li>
<li><p>B.MC. playing Polonius, Onchu's rowdy young cousin from Riverton</p></li>
<li><p>M.A.F. playing Bartha</p></li>
<li><p>C.A.H. playing Onchu</p></li>
</ul>
<p>C.A.H. is very late: <strong>–500 XP</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="introduction"><h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Bartha was gravely wounded (3 WP) in the last episode.</p>
<p>We start in the entrance room with Droston and Bartha on the exit side
of the chasm and Onchu and Polonius on the other side of the chasm,
next to the barred door into the rest of the cavern complex.</p>
</section><section id="id1"><h4>Actual Play</h4>
<section id="ropes-and-chasms"><h5>Ropes and Chasms</h5>
<p>Droston and Bartha eventually join the others across the chasm, after
entirely too much fiddling around with rope.</p>
<p>Polonius picks up a light crossbow and 12 bolts from a defeated
hobgoblin.</p>
<p>Onchu and Droston press against the door while Polonius tries to raise
the bar with a knife.  Eventually they succeed.</p>
</section><section id="a-storeroom"><h5>A Storeroom?</h5>
<p>The next room proved to be a store room with two large piles of goods
and hobgoblin sleeping gear, with a cell to the south, a
kitchen (with a chimney) off a tunnel to the south-east, a large room
off a tunnel to the north, and a tunnel to the north-east that curved
and then forked northeast again, which lead to another large room,
which later turned out to be the same as the large room off the north
tunnel.</p>
</section><section id="straight-from-the-centaur-s"><h5>Straight from the Centaur's…</h5>
<p>Bartha snuck around the the side of the southern pile of goods,
towards the cell, with Droston following with a drawn bow.  The cell
to the south turned out to contain a centaur!  Bartha, knowing
centaurs were Fey creatures thanks to her evening of revelry with the
Fey of the Lady of the Valley, rushed to free him, and tried to
converse; unfortunately, about all we could figure out was that he
recognized Whaler's fey name.  He had us all turn around and look
elsewhere while he grunted a few times, then presented Bartha with a
vial of thick colored liquid.  She drank, and was immediately healed.
She escorted the centaur back to the chasm room where it leaped the
chasm handily, and ran away.  We, stupidly, didn't follow him.</p>
</section><section id="we-were-warned"><h5>We were Warned…</h5>
<p>We were attacked by two hobgoblins from the north passage, and killed
them easily.</p>
<p>We investigated the south-east passage, which lead to an unoccupied
kitchen.</p>
<p>We investigated the north-east passage, taking the north fork, which
lead to a large room with a fire and some hobgoblins.</p>
</section><section id="but-we-didn-t-go"><h5>…But We Didn't Go</h5>
<p>We investigated the north passage, which lead to a large room.</p>
<p>We were immediately attacked by 3 hobgoblins.  Droston and Bartha
stayed in the tunnel and loosed arrows at them, while Onchu and
Polonius ran out and engaged them in melee.</p>
<p>Then three more hobgoblins showed up.  Bartha ran to the help of Onchu
and Polonius.</p>
<p>Then an ogre and two wolves showed up.  A wolf tripped Onchu, and
joined with the other wolf to tear him to shreds.  Polonius, separated
from the others, fled south-east down the large room.  Bartha fled the
room, taking with her the only light source, condemning Onchu and
Polonius to the darkness, and fled to the other end of the tunnel.
The ogre entered the tunnel and whacked Droston who screamed and
yelled for Bartha to flee and fled himself.  (Luckily he was wearing
his night vision goggles and could see to flee!)</p>
</section><section id="and-then-we-died-or-fled"><h5>And Then We Died, or Fled</h5>
<p>Onchu, meanwhile, died, and the wolves chased Polonius into the dark
of the other end of the room, and the hobgoblins followed.  Bartha and
Droston made it back to the room with the chasm, and hearing
Polonius's death cries, Droston barred the door through the handles
with a hobgoblin longsword abandoned nearby.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bartha had tied the ropes across the chasm, and she and
Droston fled into the open air beyond the caverns, where they
eventually caught up with the centaur, and they all hid, mourning
their fallen comrades.</p>
</section></section><section id="aftermath"><h4>Aftermath</h4>
<p>After the adventure, Bartha and Droston were both <strong>6200 XP</strong>
characters, and C.A.H. and B.MC. were working on new characters.</p>

<p>B.MC. contributed the following actual play report.</p>
</section><section id="id1"><h3>Actual Play</h3>
<p>Our story continues with our band of intrepid adventurers sailing
their hastily repaired skiff from the Savage Land to the pirate
haven of Brigandy Bay to sell the lumber salvaged from their
initial shipwreck. Along the way we happened upon the remains of a
battle, finding wreckage of a ship floating in the water with a
large portion of the stern section bobbing in the ocean waves. We
saw a man and a Scurilian standing on the stern yelling for help
which Murumah was happy to oblige by diving into the water to swim
over. Luckily Azrulecktos and Karl Kroc noticed the large great
white shark making its way to Marumah and Azrulecktos killed it
using his screaming water bolts.  We learned that the ship that
Black Bear (human) and Equias (Scurilian) were on was attacked by
the dread pirate Windy Jack Windham. We were able to salvage one
keg of brandy, one keg of whiskey and one keg of gunpowder.</p>
<p>We continued on to the questionable port of Brigandy Bay to find
a buyer for the lumber we had salvaged from our shipwreck on the
Savage Land and to buy provisions to travel to the larger port
of Swindon. We were able to sell three loads of lumber to Lessa
Larune for 900 pieces of 8 but Muramah had to perform a rapid
offloading of material (knocking would be pirates back) to keep
our unscrupulous buyer’s crew from stealing our skiff. Murumah
was able to find eight Grael that paid us 400 pieces of 8 (1300
total) for passage to Swindon. Twelve days of provisions for our
trip to Swindon cost 216 pieces of 8 (1084 po8 left) and the
addition of a cannon and 10 cannonballs for protection another
250 pieces of 8 (834 po8 left). There was also another cost of
280 pieces of 8 (554 po8 left)…not sure what for but I think it
was for papers to get us into Swindon with our passengers.</p>
<p>Karl Kroc’s skillful sailing helped us make the trip to Swindon in
10 days, saving 2 days worth of rations, and avoided possible
attack by Windy Jack (a well known pirate) when we spotted smoke
on the horizon, assumed to be a plundered ship. We had a tense
moment when we were boarded by the East India Company but Murumah
and the other Grael came to the rescue with their wild and raucous
singing which convinced the East India Company captain to let us
go.</p>
<p>Once we arrived in Swindon we proceeded to look for rumors and
repairs to our ship. We found both in a tavern called The
Gallows in the person of Garrin Glut. He agreed to repair our
ship for 140 pieces of 8, ½ up front and ½ after the repairs
were completed (take 3-6 days). Garrin also pointed us in the
direction of the Whip Islands for treasures…</p>
