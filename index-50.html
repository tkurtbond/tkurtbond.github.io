    <p>Well, the spring floods have arrived.  This morning when I went out to
drive to work there was water over Jesse Run Road at the mouth of Clay
Lick, a few hundred feet east from my driveway.  As I drove west down
Jesse Run Road, I could see water was over the Co Hwy 8/4, which leads
to Stretch Run, another alternate route off Jesse Run.  When I got to
the end of Jesse Run Road, water was up over the road, at least a foot
deep.  I pulled off the road to turn around, but got too far off and
got stuck in a little ditch.  Luckily the folks who live at the end of
Jesse Run, and a couple of other motorists came over and pushed me
out.  So, I'm back a home now, and it doesn't look like I'll be going
anywhere for a while.</p>

<p>L.B. was in town visiting the other side of her family, so I got to
take her to dinner Sunday.  Since she would be playing in the
Labyrinth Lord game with the rest of the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> when she was here this
summer, I thought we could create her characters during lunch.  She
thought that was a great idea.  She did wonder if people would mind us
playing D&amp;D in the restaurant, but I told her nobody would mind —
everybody in the restaurant would be talking anyway, and all we'd be
doing is talking and rolling dice.</p>
<p>I was pretty scatterbrained that morning, and had managed to forget my
dice, but we stopped at <span class="store">Dollar Tree</span> on the way to the
restaurant and picked up some cheap <strong class="dice">d6</strong>s.  While we were
waiting to be seated she started rolling up her characters, and
finished rolling them up after we'd been seated and while we were
waiting to be served.  I'd also managed to forget a pencil, but did
have a pen, so instead of writing directly on the character sheets we
wrote on some 3×5 cards I had. She'd already decided she wanted one to
be a sorceress and one to be a halfling, so we figured out which
scores should go to which character <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2009/05/03/c004-ll/#arranging-scores" id="id1">1</a> and then
rolled <strong class="dice">4d6</strong> for the characters' starting money, since we didn't
have <strong class="dice">d8</strong>s.  After that we worked through buying equipment for
her halfling, mostly while waiting for our food.  Once the food
arrived, though, not much else happened but eating. <strong>:-)</strong> She did
have a name for her magic-user/sorceress, Alice the Sorceress, and we
decided she'd pick a name for her halfling later, perhaps the next
time she's at my house.  (I‘ve got some books that would be useful for
inspiration for halfling names.)</p>
<p>Anyway, after lunch when I dropped her off I gave her some character
sheets and told her I'd e-mail her the information about the
characters — that way we'd both have the information — and that we'd
buy equipment for Alice the Sorceress later.  After I dropped her off
I stopped by the office and sent the e-mail.</p>

<p>Rather than the strict “Roll 3d6 in order for
STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA” that <em>Labyrinth Lord</em> gives as
the main way to generate abilities, I let the kids roll 3d6 and
arrange the scores the way they liked them, and let them roll a
couple of extra characters and take the highest set of scores.</p>

<h2>Attending</h2>
<p>Clockwise round the table, starting with the Labyrinth Lord:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>T.K.B., the Labyrinth Lord.</p></li>
<li><p>M.A., playing <em>James the Cleric</em> and <em>Jeffrey the Monk</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>T.A., playing <em>Glen the Strategist</em> (a wizard) and <em>Dooley the sly</em> (a thief).</p></li>
<li><p>E.A., playing <em>Curufin the Elf</em> and <em>Drusilla the Ranger</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="camping">
<h2>Camping</h2>
<p>Since everyone (pretty much) had been wounded, the characters spent 7
days camping and getting <em class="spell">Cure Light Wounds</em> cast on them by
James.  Drusilla spent the days hunting in the nearby forest, and kept
them feed reasonably well, although there were a couple of hungry
days.</p>
<p>By the 7<sup>th</sup> day the orcs started to stink, so they buried
them, still in their leather armor.  After they buried them they
realized they could have sold the armor, but after several days of
decomposition the armor was probably not salable any more.</p>
<p>They divided the coin up, with 10 sp each, with 4 left over for the
party treasury.  Glen paid his 10 sp immediately to Dooley, which
after the interest left him still 12.5 sp in debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oops">
<h2>Oops!</h2>
<p>On the eight day they continued north along the road that lead into
the borderlands.  Before the valley closed in, they could see the
outline of the hills under the trees curving in sharply on the west,
while the east side continued straight and steep.  As they walked
along the narrow valley, Drusilla noticed some light tracks leading
into the thick forest to the west, although she couldn't tell what had
made the tracks.  They decided to follow the tracks through the
forest.  After a lot of bending and crawling and scraping through the
thick undergrowth they emerged in a small, partially forested valley.
One of the first things that they saw was a cave opening on the south
side of the valley.  Whooping and hollering they headed straight for
the cave.  They'd only gotten 30 feet in and had noticed that the
original cave had been turned into tunnels carved from the rock, when
they ran into a group of goblins, who yelled <strong>“Bree-Yark!”</strong> and
attacked.  The characters, though several had been injured, were doing
pretty well, having killed 5 of the 6 goblins, when two more groups of
6 goblins appeared, one in front and another behind, an they heard
something <em>big</em> stopping its way down the corridor toward them.  The
new goblins all threw javelins, and by the end of the round Glen and
Dooley were on the ground dying, and the rest of adventurers were
severely wounded, though still standing.  And that's when the ogre
arrived, stomping down the corridor.  With the goblins behind them
blocking their way out, things were looking grim.</p>
<p>At this point I suggested to the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> that perhaps surrender would be
a good idea, if the goblins thought the adventurers could be ransomed.
Luckily, Curufin knew how to speak goblin, an quickly offered
surrender and ransom, which the goblins accepted.  They quickly
stripped and tied the adventurers and negotiated a 10 gp ransom each,
to be paid no later than 2 days from now.</p>
<p>The PCs picked Jeffry to go back to town and get the ransom, as he
actually had enough to ransom everybody <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2009/05/02/p002-ll/#kindness" id="id1">1</a>, and although he had a close
call on the way back, having to hide from a group of orcs out looking
for something, he managed to get back in time, and the goblins kept
their word and released the adventurers, wearing nothing but
breech-clouts.</p>
<p>The adventurers hurried back to the Keep to regroup.  They expected
the townsfolk to be mad that they'd stirred up the monsters, but the
townsfolk said that the monsters had been killing people already, and
at least the adventurers had killed some of the monsters.  The
townsfolk did suggest the adventurers should be a <em>little</em> more
careful next time.</p>
<p>So, the adventurers are safe, but they've lost most of their money,
all of their equipment, and somehow have to reequip.  T.A. suggested
they look for work around the Keep to help get money for new
equipment.  And that's where we left them.</p>

<p><cite>Double Adventure 1: Shadows &amp; Annic Nova</cite>, by Marc W. Miller;
copyright © 1980 by Game Designers' Workshop; 7th printing;
Product #312.  Art on page 19 by Liz Danforth.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how these adventures differ from current
adventure design.  Both of these adventures present a location with
details about its contents, and give a way that a group of player
characters might get involved.  One of the adventures gives a page
of historical background of the location for the GM, although the
background doesn't directly affect play.  The other gives no history
at all, other than what can be gleaned from observing the location.</p>
<p>The trend in commercial RPG adventure design has been to deliver
more and more detail for the GM, culminating in the current D&amp;D
adventure format that attempts to provide, on a two-page spread,
absolutely everything that a DM has to have to run a tactical
encounter, from the tactical map to the exact details of each and
every NPC involved, so that the DM doesn't have to look anything up.
Moreover, in many modules, perhaps starting with the <cite>Dragonlance</cite>
modules in the 1980s, there is a story supplied, which the player
characters are expected, more or less, to follow and figure out, and
some more-or-less obvious goal.</p>
<p><cite>Shadows</cite> &amp; <cite>Annic Nova</cite> certainly don't supply a pre-built story —
any story will be generated by the referee and players at the gaming
table, with possibly some pre-game activity by the referee while
reading the adventure beforehand.  And there are no obvious goals,
just situations to explore.</p>
<p>I actually find this rather liberating, compared to the more
detailed adventures that are more common today.  There is something
about the things that aren't there in <cite>Shadows</cite> &amp; <cite>Annic Nova</cite> that
fires up my imagination and draws me into the situation.  It's
probably the same sort of thing that makes me see the original
<cite>Greyhawk</cite> folio as more interesting that the later <cite>Living Greyhawk
Gazetteer</cite>.</p>
<p>I mention Liz Danforth in the info about the book above because ever
since I ran across her art in 5th edition <cite>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</cite> I've
enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>I like the physical design of the Classic Traveller books.  The 8½×5½
stapled booklet is just the right size, physically, to read easily and
carry around, and it opens and lays flat, for easy reference.  As far
as the information content, the physical constraints of the format
provides enough physical space to present a comprehensible amount of
information, without enough the temptation to pad the content with
irrelevancies.</p>
<p>I also like visual appearance of these books: the black covers of the
original books — with white text for the book title and subtitle, and red
text and a thick red line for the game title and publisher — were
stark, attractive, and stand out even today.</p>
<p>I gather, from comments from Steve Jackson Games, on the comic-book
sized booklets they printed for the <em>GURPS Traveller</em> line in the
early 2000s, that books of these form factors aren't cost effective
for traditional RPG publishers any more.  That's a pity.</p>

“The Olympia Incident” by Martin J. Dougherty.</p>
<p>This is a reprint of the 1981 second edition of <cite>Traveller</cite>, along
with a little bit about the publishing history of <cite>Traveller</cite>, and a
short story, “The Olympia Incident”, set in the <cite>Traveller</cite>
universe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was first getting into gaming, I remember going on a trip to
Morgantown, WV with my brother and some of his friends from high
school who were in the gaming group that I'd recently joined.  We
visited a couple of places that sold gaming materials, and one of the
group, R.S. if I remember correctly, bought a copy of <cite>Traveller</cite>.  I
remember reading the books in his basement rec room and trying to make
characters.  Unfortunately, at that point the only RPGs that our group
had seen were variants of D&amp;D (T&amp;T and DQ were still a couple years
away), and I, at least, never really figured out <cite>Traveller</cite> and what
you could do with it, and, again if I remember correctly, our group
never did much with <cite>Traveller</cite>.</p>
<p>Something must have struck a cord, however, because over the years I
bought several editions of the game, from <cite>Megatraveller</cite> to
<cite>Traveller: the New Era</cite> (also known as <cite>T:NE</cite>), to <cite>GURPS Traveller</cite>,
to <cite>Marc Miller's Traveller</cite> (also known as <cite>T4</cite>), and even including
<cite>2300AD</cite>, which was originally published as <cite>Traveller: 2300</cite>, even
though the mechanics and setting were in no way related to the
<cite>Traveller</cite> mechanics or setting.  Many of this I probably picked up
during a long period where I wasn't doing any gaming, and just reading
game books. (This would almost certainly have been before the
explosion of RPG stores on the net.)  I probably picked
<cite>Megatraveller</cite> up after it was out of print; my copy seems to have
the (infamous) errata fixed.  I may have picked up <cite>T:NE</cite> when it
first came out.  I know I picked up almost all of the <cite>GURPS
Traveller</cite> books as they came out.  I'm sure I picked up <cite>2300AD</cite> off
the discount rack.  I remember being saddened when GDW closed their
doors, although that was in part due to really enjoying their <cite>Space:
1889</cite> line and Frank Chadwick's <cite>Cadillacs &amp; Dinosaurs</cite> RPG, based on
Mark Schultz's comic books, which I had read and enjoyed.  I never got
a chance to play any of GDW's games while they were still in
operation, but have always wanted to play a game with <cite>Space: 1889</cite>'s
background.  I never figured out what to do with <cite>Traveller</cite>,
though. I came closest with <cite>GURPS Traveller</cite>, having enjoyed playing
<cite>GURPS</cite> before my gaming hiatus.  I enjoyed reading all the <cite>GURPS
Traveller</cite> books, but I had no gaming group at that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, years later, after I'd gotten back to gaming regularly, in
2007, I had been reading about a number of people who had been playing
Classic <cite>Traveller</cite>, which is what folks called the original system,
with or without the Traveller Universe.  They praised the game for its
simplicity and completeness and for its relatively small size.  I had
know about the Far Future Enterprises Classic <cite>Traveller</cite> reprint
line, but couldn't afford them when they first came out.  I did,
however, find a an inexpensive reprint of just Books 1–3, published
jointly by Far Future Enterprises and QuikLink Interactive (also know
as QLI/RPGRealms), and I ordered it in October 2007.  After some
problems with QLI's order system, I finally received my copy in
November, 2007.  It was a reprint of the 1981 2nd edition of
<cite>Traveller</cite>, which apparently cleaned up the rules a little bit.  I
read it quickly, and my reaction was: “Huh.  Why didn't we play the
heck out of this back in high school?  I could see playing this
<em>today</em> and having a blast!”  I liked the basic simplicity of the
system, having moved away from complex systems like <cite>GURPS</cite> to systems
that were much simpler, like <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>.</p>
<p>Sometime later I got Mongoose Publishing's new edition of
<cite>Traveller</cite>,and though it was a reasonable version.  Certainly it was
closest of any system to the original, definitely since
<cite>Megatraveller</cite>, and possibly since the original itself.  And the fact
Mongoose released it with several licenses that allowed free use of
the system, and some use of the background made it more attractive.
It prompted me to go back and read most of my other versions of
<cite>Traveller</cite>, including the FFE/QLI reprint of Books 1–3.  After
looking at them all, it was Classic <cite>Traveller</cite> I wanted to play.  Since
then I've gathered some of the original <cite>Traveller</cite> publications, and
a couple volumes of the FFE reprint volumes.  (I wish they were all
still in print.)</p>
<p>I'm going to have to run a Classic <cite>Traveller</cite> game sometime soon.</p>

<p>I like to stick to Free/Libre (as in freedom) and Open Source Software
as much as I can, but I haven't found a open source program that lets
me add text on existing PDF documents yet, so I use a commercial but
free (as in costs nothing for personal use) program
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer">PDF-XChange Viewer</a>, which can be downloaded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.docu-track.com/downloads/users/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the other commercial but free programs that allow you
to add text to existing documents, PDF-XChange Viewer doesn't add any
nagware watermarking to the document to indicate that it was produced
with the free version, so you can use it fill out forms in PDF
documents that don't have electric form fields, which is very useful on
long forms.</p>
<p>It's not perfect — I've had trouble with it on a few PDFs that seemed
to have pathological defects — but overall it works well.</p>
<p>I'd still rather have a Free/Libre or Open Source program, though.</p>

<h2>Attack in the Dark</h2>
<p>Once the <a class="reference external" href="categories/cat_gaming/actual-play/the-kids/">kids</a> had gotten their characters completed we only had about
30 minutes to play before I had to be elsewhere. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="posts/2009/04/26/p001-ll-attack-in-the-dark/#posts" id="id1">1</a> While they
were finishing their characters, I finally decided to start with <em>B2 —
Keep on the Borderlands</em>, so I started with them approaching the keep
entryway.  We spent a little time in the keep, talking to people and
then left to find the monsters we'd heard were plaguing the area.  The
characters followed the road north where they'd heard merchants had
been attacked, looking for trouble.  They hadn't found any by the end
of the day, so they camped in the bend of the road and set watches
through the night, with no campfire or lights burning.  During
Jeffrey's watch he was surprised by a volley of javelins from the dark
He couldn't really see what was going on, but he woke the others, and
Curufin could see that they were being attacked by orcs.  Jeffrey
started lighting a torch for the humans to see by, Curufin started
shooting his bow at the orcs, Dooley charged up to the orcs to fight
them hand-to-hand, and Drusilla also headed up to the orcs to right.
Despite the penalties for fighting in the dark they were able to score
some hits, and once the torch was light things got easier.  They
finally killed all the orcs.  Pretty much everybody had been injured,
but nobody had been killed.  They decided to start a campfire to
finish out the night with some light.</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>There were 6 orcs, with 8 sp, 11 sp, 12 sp, 12 sp, 9 sp, and 12 sp,
respectively.  Each orc had 2 javelins, a short sword, and tatty
leather armor.</p>
<p>[This is an <a class="reference external" href="posts/2009/05/03/after-the-fact/">after-the-fact</a> entry; I could have sworn I'd written something
about this already, but if so I've lost it.  I'm not sure what date
and time this actually happened.  Sigh.  I think it was nap time for
the youngest kids.]</p>

<p>In this short session T.A. finished his two characters,
M.A. created his second character, Jeffrey, a monk, and E.A. created
her characters, Drusilla (Dru), a ranger, and Curufin, an elf.  I
helped E.A. by quickly equipping her characters when time was running
short, while T.A. helped M.A.</p>
<p>T.A. and M.A. were bickering, so I said that they had to roleplay
being best friends.  Glen needed to borrow some money, and I said he
could borrow it from Dooley, but that Dooley would charge 25%
interest, compounded weekly.</p>
