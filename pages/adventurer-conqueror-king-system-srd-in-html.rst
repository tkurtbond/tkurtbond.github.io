I have two HTML versions of the ACKS SRD available:

- Everything in `one file`_, which makes searching it easy, but it's
  slower to load.
- Divided up by Chapters_, which makes it a little faster to load.

.. _one file: /ACKS/acks_srd.html
.. _Chapters: /ACKS/chapters/index.html

Both of these are based on the `Markdown SRD`_, which was forked from
the `Text SRD`_.  The chapters version is produced directly from the
`Markdown SRD`_.  The one file version is produced from a lightly
edited version of the `Markdown SRD`_ processed through pandoc_.

.. _Markdown SRD: https://github.com/jhhoffmann/ACKS_SRD
.. _Text SRD: https://github.com/jhhoffmann/ACKS_SRD
.. _pandoc: https://pandoc.org/

Producing PDFs from the Markdown files via pandoc would be difficult,
as there are several tables that are too wide to fit on a page.  Go
buy the `ACKS pdf`_ if you want an nice looking PDF.
