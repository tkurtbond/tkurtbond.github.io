I intermittently GamesMastered a campaign set in in a modified version
of SPI_'s `Frontiers of Alusia`__ from 1985 to December 1994.  As time
went by the players and I dispersed geographically and acquired more
responsibilities, so we did not play as much in that time as one might
first expect.

This was originally (of course) using the 
:doc:`DragonQuest <dragonquest>` rules from SPI, but when I started playing
`GURPS`_ I eventually changed to using it for this campaign.

A few years ago, while writing a new adventure for the campaign, I got
`ambitious <notes#why>`__ and from my notes wrote a 55 page (5.5 by
8.5 inches booklet size) campaign history.  Some time ago (1995/11/9)
I created a hypertext version (using Unroff_; see Notes_ for more
details about the that tool) and added (1996/1/21) the last two
adventures (although in very rough form) and created an on-line
permuted index.  (These are not available any more, alas.)

Later, in December 2007, I finally finished a new
`DocBook-based <http://www.docbook.org/whatis>`__ version (which was
also available as a single html file and as a PDF file that includes
some some additional information and reflections.  It was fun to
revisit the campaign. (These too are not available any more.)

In December 2009 I made a minor revision to the DocBook version,
available in several HTML pages, a single HTML page, and a PDF file
(Among other things, this cleaned up the text encoding of the HTML
output.) (These too are not available any more.)

Finally, in November 2019 I converted the document to DocBook 5.  The
results are available as a `HTML file </partyhist.html>`_ and a `PDF
File </partyhist.pdf>`_.

After the fact, one of the players, N.A.B., named the adventuring
party “The Sons of the Vale”, after the Vale of Morin, the valley
which they contracted to resettle on behalf of the ghosts that haunted
the place, and that's now the name of the campaign.
