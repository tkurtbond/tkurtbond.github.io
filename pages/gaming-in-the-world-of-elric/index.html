<p>There are a number of good reasons for role-playing in the world of
<cite class="series">Elric</cite>.</p>
<p>The setting provides a background where moral questions are important
enough to be interesting: uncertain enough for a GamesMaster to avoid
the simplistic dualism of Good vs. Evil, but not so complicated that
everything becomes amoral.  The amount of uncertainly is also easily
tailored to the preferences of the GamesMaster and players.</p>
<p>The “Young Kingdoms” just before and during Elric's adventures are in
a period of great growth, socially, religiously, politically, and
commercially, providing many opportunities for interesting adventures
as the each of the Young Kingdoms strives for wealth, power, and
prestige.  Characters might promote or oppose the Churches of Law on
the Isle of Purple Towns or in Vilmir, or the Churches of Chaos in
Dharijor or Pikarayd, or they might reject both and look to the
Balance.  They might involve themselves in the mercantile or political
struggles of the merchants of the Isle of Purple Towns or of Ilmiora's
city-states.</p>
<p>The remnants of the Melnibonéans and their predecessors provide
abundant examples of the fantastic underpinings of the world, while
the machinations of the Lords of Chaos and Law can provide long-term
continuity and challenges to even the most powerful of characters.
Characters may choose to search for these fantastic treasures, or
investigate the otherworldly entities frequently summoned by
Melniboné in its prime, or directly approach the Lords of Law or
Chaos.</p>
<p>Moreover, via Michael Moorcock's concept of intersecting realities,
the “Million Spheres”, Elric's world is connected to just about any
setting one could imagine, ranging from <cite class="series">Hawkmoon</cite>'s mad world of
decaying science to the polymorphous near future/past of Jerry
Corniellius or <cite class="series">Corum</cite>'s world of subtle art and science over-run by
barbaric Mabden.</p>
<p>Finally, the impending doom of the Young Kingdoms at Elric's hand can
help lend an air of tragedy and urgency to the game.  (Without unwanted
excesses of angst!)</p>

<p>Early in the Spring of 2001 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chaosium.com/">Chaosium</a>
released <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chaosium.com/woec/2017.shtml">Dragon Lords of Melniboné</a> as the first item in the
<cite class="series">Worlds of the Eternal Champion</cite> series of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/">D20</a> products, compatible with the new
version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/">Wizards of the Coast</a>.  <cite>Dragon Lords of
Melniboné</cite> adapts the background and some of the mechanics of
Chaosium's <cite>Elric!</cite> role-playing game to the <cite>D20</cite> system, making it
easy for <cite>D&amp;D</cite> players to game in the world of Elric and Stormbringer.
It also adds some news detail to the setting.  At least two <cite>D20</cite>
adventures and a sourcebook are planned.  The first adventure, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chaosium.com/woec/2018.shtml">Slaves
of Fate</a>, was published,
but as far as I know none of the others ever were.</p>
<p>Later in the year, Chaosium released <cite>Stormbringer</cite>, 5th Edition as
the successor to <cite>Elric!</cite>, using the same mechanics as <cite>Elric!</cite> and
the new details from <cite>Dragon Lords of Melniboné</cite>.</p>
<p>The long awaited <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a> <cite>Corum</cite> supplement for <cite>Elric!</cite> was been
published under license from Chaosium in June 2001 by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.darcsyde.org/">Darcsyde
Productions</a>.  Unfortunately, they never
got to publish their <cite>Hawkmoon</cite> supplement.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/">Mongoose Publishing</a> published
various Million Spheres games for their versions of RuneQuest-derived.</p>
<dl class="footnote brackets">
<dt class="label" id="id2"><span class="brackets"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">1</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This supplement was originally written for <cite>Stormbringer</cite>, then
revised when <cite>Stormbringer</cite> was replaced by <cite>Elric!</cite>, and and was
finally published in a form compatable with <cite>Stormbringer</cite>, 5th
Edition, which replaced <cite>Elric!</cite>.  Got that?</p>
