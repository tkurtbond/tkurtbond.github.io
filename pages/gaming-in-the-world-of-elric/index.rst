Why Role-play In the World of Elric?
------------------------------------

There are a number of good reasons for role-playing in the world of
:series:`Elric`.

The setting provides a background where moral questions are important
enough to be interesting: uncertain enough for a GamesMaster to avoid
the simplistic dualism of Good vs. Evil, but not so complicated that
everything becomes amoral.  The amount of uncertainly is also easily
tailored to the preferences of the GamesMaster and players.

The “Young Kingdoms” just before and during Elric's adventures are in
a period of great growth, socially, religiously, politically, and
commercially, providing many opportunities for interesting adventures
as the each of the Young Kingdoms strives for wealth, power, and
prestige.  Characters might promote or oppose the Churches of Law on
the Isle of Purple Towns or in Vilmir, or the Churches of Chaos in
Dharijor or Pikarayd, or they might reject both and look to the
Balance.  They might involve themselves in the mercantile or political
struggles of the merchants of the Isle of Purple Towns or of Ilmiora's
city-states.

The remnants of the Melnibonéans and their predecessors provide
abundant examples of the fantastic underpinings of the world, while
the machinations of the Lords of Chaos and Law can provide long-term
continuity and challenges to even the most powerful of characters.
Characters may choose to search for these fantastic treasures, or
investigate the otherworldly entities frequently summoned by
Melniboné in its prime, or directly approach the Lords of Law or
Chaos.

Moreover, via Michael Moorcock's concept of intersecting realities,
the “Million Spheres”, Elric's world is connected to just about any
setting one could imagine, ranging from :series:`Hawkmoon`'s mad world of
decaying science to the polymorphous near future/past of Jerry
Corniellius or :series:`Corum`'s world of subtle art and science over-run by
barbaric Mabden.

Finally, the impending doom of the Young Kingdoms at Elric's hand can
help lend an air of tragedy and urgency to the game.  (Without unwanted
excesses of angst!)



Other Million Spheres Gaming!
-----------------------------

Early in the Spring of 2001 `Chaosium <http://www.chaosium.com/>`__
released `Dragon Lords of Melniboné
<http://www.chaosium.com/woec/2017.shtml>`__ as the first item in the
:series:`Worlds of the Eternal Champion` series of
`D20 <http://www.wizards.com/D20/>`__ products, compatible with the new
version of `Dungeons & Dragons <http://www.wizards.com/D20/>`__ from
`Wizards of the Coast <http://www.wizards.com/>`__.  `Dragon Lords of
Melniboné` adapts the background and some of the mechanics of
Chaosium's `Elric!` role-playing game to the `D20` system, making it
easy for `D&D` players to game in the world of Elric and Stormbringer.
It also adds some news detail to the setting.  At least two `D20`
adventures and a sourcebook are planned.  The first adventure, `Slaves
of Fate <http://www.chaosium.com/woec/2018.shtml>`__, was published,
but as far as I know none of the others ever were.

Later in the year, Chaosium released `Stormbringer`, 5th Edition as
the successor to `Elric!`, using the same mechanics as `Elric!` and
the new details from `Dragon Lords of Melniboné`.

The long awaited [1]_ `Corum` supplement for `Elric!` was been
published under license from Chaosium in June 2001 by `Darcsyde
Productions <http://www.darcsyde.org/>`__.  Unfortunately, they never
got to publish their `Hawkmoon` supplement.

`Mongoose Publishing <http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/>`__ published
various Million Spheres games for their versions of RuneQuest-derived.

.. [1] This supplement was originally written for `Stormbringer`, then
   revised when `Stormbringer` was replaced by `Elric!`, and and was
   finally published in a form compatable with `Stormbringer`, 5th
   Edition, which replaced `Elric!`.  Got that?
