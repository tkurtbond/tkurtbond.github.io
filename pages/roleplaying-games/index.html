    <p>Roleplaying Games have been described as “Let's Pretend with
Rules” or “Improvisational Radio Theater”.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing Roleplaying Games (RPG), both as a GamesMaster and a
player, although I don't get to do either as much as I'd like. For a
long time I was the the only one in my gaming group foolish or
enlightened enough to GM, so I rarely got to play. Luckily, that
changed, and the group I'm currently playing with has a couple of good
GMs.</p>

<p>If you've wandered into the conversation in the middle, and are
wondering what roleplaying games are, here is a good <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microtactix.com/whatrpg.htm">introduction</a>.</p>
</section><section id="how-i-got-started"><h2>How I got started</h2>
<p>My introduction to roleplaying games was the Christmas present from my
parents of the Holmes Basic <cite>D&amp;D</cite> boxed set. Soon thereafter I was
playing <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> with my brother's friends from high school, and a
little later I was DungeonMastering myself. My gaming group ran across
<cite>Traveller</cite>, but were still focused on fantasy and didn't pursue
it. We also ran across Tunnels and Trolls, and had fun with
it.</p>
<p>Sometime in the mid-1980s I borrowed a copy of <cite>DragonQuest</cite>, and
found its flexibility so attractive I had to buy my own copy, and was
soon running <cite>DragonQuest</cite> games, including the classic SPI adventure
<cite>The Enchanted Wood</cite>. Sometime in the mid-1980's I stopped playing <cite>D&amp;D</cite>
and <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> entirely (thus almost missing out on <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> 2nd edition
completely); At some time after this I found a copy of 2nd edition
<cite>GURPS</cite>, and then 3rd edition, and started using it for most of my
roleplaying games.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of other game systems, but unfortunately the game stores
in my area usually didn't carry much beyond TSR's products, and if
they carried anything else they rarely carried anything except the
core rules. So, for instance, I found <cite>RuneQuest</cite> (3rd edition), but I
never bought any <cite>RuneQuest</cite> supplements other than <cite>Griffon Island</cite>
(probably because they weren't available locally), so I didn't really
learn anything about Glorantha until running across it on USENET news
groups and the Internet years later.</p>
</section><section id="some-interesting-roleplaying-games"><h2>Some Interesting Roleplaying Games</h2>
<p>Some RPGs I enjoy are the following (in no particular order):</p>
<section id="prince-valiant"><h3>Prince Valiant</h3>
<p><cite>Prince Valiant</cite>, Greg Stafford's 1989 game from chaosium based on
Hal Foster's legendary Sunday cartoon strips, is the idea game for
introducing folks to roleplaying games: it has simple rules, clear
presentation, a setting that is known to almost everybody, and a
number of short adventures included in the book makes it easy to pick
up and play anytime, and easy for new players to understand. Too bad
it is out of print. (This, by the way, was the original “Story
Telling Game”.) <cite>Pendragon</cite>, Stafford's next Arthurian game, is a
wonderful game for the confirmed gamer, but doesn't serve as well as
an introductory game.</p>
</section><section id="gurps"><h3>GURPS</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/">GURPS</a>, by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sjgames.com">Steve Jackson
Games</a>, the Generic Universal
Roleplaying System, is particularly well supported with sourcebooks.</p>
<p>I've been following GURPS since the 2nd edition days, and have over
150 GURPS books.  Oddly enough, I haven't bought anything for 4th
edition GURPS except <cite>GURPS Traveller: Interstellar Wars</cite>.  I guess
the two-volume basic set turned me off, and I'm using simpler
systems these days, anyway.  I suppose I'll get back to GURPS
eventually.</p>
<p>2017 Update: I backed the kickstarter for Steve Jackson Games <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sjgames.com/dungeonfantasy/">Dungeon
Fantasy Roleplaying Game</a> (DFRPG),
and it prompted an interest in GURPS 4th Edition.  I now have the
Basic Set, and several of the other books.  DFRPG looks good.</p>
</section><section id="bunnies-burrows"><h3>Bunnies &amp; Burrows</h3>
<p>I had never seen the original <cite>Bunnies &amp; Burrows</cite> game, but I bought
the GURPS version, written by Steffan O'Sullivan, and absolutely loved
it.  This was the setting I used in the first RPG sessions I did with the
kids in the family, though I used the Fudge RPG system, also written
by Steffan O'Sullivan.  I was finally able to buy a PDF of the
original <cite>Bunnies &amp; Burrows</cite> game over the Internet in 2011.</p>

</section><section id="big-eyes-small-mouth"><h3>Big Eyes, Small Mouth</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.on.ca/">BESM</a> (<cite>Big Eyes, Small Mouth</cite>)
from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com">Guardians of Order</a>, an anime RPG, is a good game even for
those who aren't really anime fans. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The second edition is
especially good, giving you a lite, flexible system that works
reasonably well from normal humans to over-the-top superheros, as well
as integrated robot/mecha/vehicle and magic design systems. If someone
asked me to recommend a good universal roleplaying game that was
simpler than the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.herogames.com/">Hero System</a> from Hero
Games, better at high-power levels than <cite>CORPS</cite>, and complete in one
book (unlike <cite>GURPS</cite>), I'd say <cite>BESM</cite> would be a good
choice. <cite>Tri-Stat dX</cite>, released in July 2003, looks like a fairly
comprehensive synthesis of <cite>BESM</cite> and Guardians superhero game,
SAS. dX is a bit crunchier than <cite>BESM</cite>, and is completely generic
(without the anime trappings of <cite>BESM</cite>), but at 10$US for the printed
version and free for the PDF it's definitely a great value. I hope
this does well for Guardians. Personally, though, I was glad that
Guardians still supported <cite>BESM</cite>, since the addition of PMV s to
<cite>Tri-Stat dX</cite> adds just enough extra complexity to the base system to
turn some people off. I don't think it's actually that much more
complicated, but it certainly gives that appearance.  <cite>BESM</cite>'s
more-or-less effects-based powers system is pretty flexible, but the
effects-based paradigm takes some getting used to; I remember being
surprised and delighted when I learned that in <cite>BESM</cite> a <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>-like
thief backstab ability is something that you build with the standard
<cite>Weapon Attack</cite> attribute with a couple of weapon disabilities. This
system does seem to work well for anime-type characters, who may all
have weird and unique powers. Mostly things are well defined, like
Weapon Attack, but there are a few places where things are a lot more
fuzzy. Overall it works pretty well, and is much simpler than <cite>Hero</cite>.</p>
<section id="besm-3e"><h4>BESM 3E</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.white-wolf.com/besm/">Big Eyes, Small Mouth, 3rd edition</a> was published by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.white-wolf.com/">White Wolf</a> division <a class="reference external" href="http://www.white-wolf.com/arthaus/index.php">Arthaus</a> division after <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com">Guardians of Order</a>
ceased operations, and I got my copies on 2007/01/30. On a brief but
reasonably complete scan it looks like a good further development of
<cite>BESM</cite> 2nd edition, gaining the benefits of the various Tri-Stat
implementations while becoming only a little more complex, with
options to reduce the complexity to about that of 2nd edition or
perhaps even a little less. It is compatible in philosophy and spirit
to the earlier editions, but characters are not directly
compatible. It made me want to play it when I read it, which is always
a good test. Except for that fact that it is already (at the end of
2007; at least it is still available in PDF) out of print it makes a
good alternative to Hero or GURPS for those looking for something
mechanically simpler.  There were some minor errata in the first
printing, and the author (and former proprietor of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com">Guardians of
Order</a>) Mark C. Mackinnon made the <a class="reference external" href="http://guardiansorder.livejournal.com/19955.html">corrections</a> available.</p>
<p>(These errata have vanished in the mists of time, so I've made them
available on my site (<a class="reference external" href="../../BESM3/BESM3E_errata.pdf">BESM3Errata</a>), along with the two pages (<a class="reference external" href="../../BESM3/BESM3_page154.pdf">P154</a>, <a class="reference external" href="../../BESM3/BESM3_page168.pdf">P168</a>)
that were horribly misprinted.)</p>
</section><section id="besm-4e"><h4>BESM 4E</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/japanimegames/besm-fourth-edition-big-eyes-small-mouth-rpg/">BESM 4th Edition</a> was launched with a Kickstarter in 2019, and
supplemented with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dyskami/besm-extras-fourth-edition-rpg-expansions/">BESM Extras</a> in 2020.  All-in-all, I like the
changes it made to the system, but dislike the graphic design of the
books.  (I preferred the third edition graphic design.)  I wish that
some of the things in <cite>BESM Extras</cite> were in the core rulebook, but
overall I'm happy with the two books.  It is still a little more
complex than BESM second edition, which hit a sweet spot for me, but
looks like it will be a lot of fun.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.talislanta.com/">Talislanta</a>, created by Stephan
Michael Sechi in 1987, is an exotic, quirky, fantasy roleplaying game
somewhat influenced by Jack Vance's fantasy novels. It avoided
the European cultural and mythological cliches at the base of so many
fantasy worlds, and used the slogan “No Elves” in one of its best
remembered ads. It was republished in a fourth edition by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shootingiron.com">Shooting
Iron</a> in July 2001, and the first
print run of 1600 copies sold out in only two months. The second
printing became available sometime around November or <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/talislanta-l/message/19643">December</a> 2002.

edition is now now published by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardiansorder.com">Guardians of Order</a>, which hopes to
publish additional supplements for it in the future.</p>
</section><section id="savage-worlds"><h3>Savage Worlds</h3>
<p><cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peginc.com/">Pinnacle Entertainment Group</a>'s “Fast! Furious! Fun!” generic RPG.
I'd read about it and looked at the Test Drive several times, but it
hadn't really clicked for me until I read grubman's <a class="reference external" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=207839">101 days of
Savage Worlds</a> of
2005-07-26 on rpg.net. I got the revised version in late 2005 and was
delighted by its mix of simplicity, versatility, and moderate tactical
detail.</p>
<p><cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is designed for folks who want something that is easy to
prepare for and easy and fast to run, and I think it suceeds at these
goals very well. Characters start off competent and get better, but
are never invulnerable. The core rulebook works well for fantasy,
science fiction, historical, and pulp-level heroics and horror. It is
not super detailed, concentrating on low overhead. The core rulebook
is very complete, containing everything you need to play, including a
nifty mass combat system, vehicle rules, a sampling of creatures, and
so forth. It is well supported, with a line of interesting
setting/campaign books (fantasy, fantasy pirates, super-villains,
weird wild west) and a number of good PDF adventures (zombies,
fantasy, 1930s, TV parody, Kids in Idyllic England), and there are
third-party publishers who also produce for it, as well as a sizable
fan community.</p>
<p>I've been playing <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> with my daughter and her cousins
(occasionally with my brothers mixed in) and it has gone very well. I
started out by playing a lot of short adventures, then ran
<cite>Evernight</cite>, a fantasy campaign.  To compare it to <cite>Big Eyes,
Small Mouth</cite>, it has simpler character generation, more tactical
options in combat, but actually less bookkeeping during combat. <cite>BESM</cite>
has a more flexible powers/magic system, but <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>
powers/magic system works well for most things, and can be easily
expanded.</p>
<p>I've also played a number of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> one-shots with my D&amp;D
gaming group, when the regular D&amp;D game couldn't run for one reason or
another.</p>
</section><section id="dungeons-and-dragons"><h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
<p><cite>D&amp;D</cite> is where I got my start, but I moved away from it during the
ending of the <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> years. At that time I was looking for something
with more verisimilitude and detail and less arbitrary restrictions.
To be honest, I was sick of <cite>D&amp;D</cite> and that colored my reactions for
years afterwards.</p>
<p>I've since come to see the pros as well as the cons of <cite>D&amp;D</cite>, and
though it's not my favorite RPG I can deal with it much better these
days.</p>
<p>The <cite>D&amp;D</cite> <cite>Rules Cyclopedia</cite> is an amazing feat: one book that
encapsulates the best of traditional <cite>D&amp;D</cite> in an amazingly complete
package. This book makes me wish I'd run or played Basic/Expert/RC
<cite>D&amp;D</cite>. I've since found that several of the Basic/Expert <cite>D&amp;D</cite> modules
are classics (thank goodness for inexpensive PDFs of out-of-print
games!), and the combination is almost enough to prompt me to run a
few RC <cite>D&amp;D</cite> games. Almost. (Maybe I'll run a <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> game
using those modules.)</p>
<p>First edition <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> has a quirky charm that 2nd edition lacks,
perhaps largely due to Gygax's odd but educational writing
style. Reading later editions of <cite>D&amp;D</cite> puts me to sleep in only a few
pages, but even when I'm confused by Gygax's prose it never puts me to
sleep.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 2nd edition <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> is definitely easier to understand.</p>
<p>Third edition <cite>D&amp;D</cite> and the more-or-less minor update 3.5E <cite>D&amp;D</cite> are
very well <em>designed</em> and designed very <em>tightly</em>, but they're not the
first game I'd reach for when I wanted to play something. Mechanically
they are more complicated and less flexible than I prefer at this
point in my life (although much more flexible mechanically than 1st or
2nd editions), and they encode a great number of things in the core
rules that I'd prefer to leave out. Many of these things make <cite>D&amp;D</cite>
characters seem less real to me: it's hard to squeeze a real character
into a “1st level rogue”. On the other hand, for the type of game-play
for which they are designed, they're excellent, and I'd not hesitate
to play in a 3rd or 3.5th edition campaign. And while I'd not prefer
not to write my own campaign from scratch (3.0E and 3.5E stat blocks
are things of horror) I've happily run one from prewritten modules.</p>
<p>4th edition looks interesting, mechanically. It looks like it has been
tightly focus on making all the base classes much more fun to play in
the tactical battlemap-and-miniatures mode. Unfortunately, it also
seems to have shifted entirely to supporting gamist play, leaving
nowhere for simulationist play. As for the fluff and fluff related
mechanics, such as the selection of races and classes and the changes
to alignment, I'm quite displeased. I finally played 4E in 2009, and
while it is fun for the type of game for which it was designed, it has
a much more narrowed focus than earlier editions.</p>
</section><section id="tunnels-trolls"><h3>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</h3>
<p><cite>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</cite>, also know as <cite>T&amp;T</cite> is another early RPG that is
a lot of fun.</p>
</section><section id="hero"><h3>Hero</h3>
<p>I bought a number of <cite>Hero</cite> books in the 4th edition days, and have
the 5th edition <cite>Sidekick</cite> (a marvelous distillation of the system),
and like the infinite customizability of the system, but it's a bit
more complicated than I've felt I could get my players to swallow.  I
keep thinking I should pick up the main core rulebook and some of the
genre books, but haven't got around to it yet.</p>
</section><section id="mutants-masterminds-2e-and-true20"><h3>Mutants &amp; Masterminds, 2E and True20</h3>
<p>Two of the many good things to come out of the D20 era are Green
Ronin's OGL game <cite>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</cite> and it's cousin <cite>True20</cite> .  I
have the second edition of <cite>M&amp;M</cite>, and while I haven't played it yet, I
think it would be a wonderful generic system along the lines of <cite>Hero</cite>
and <cite>GURPS</cite>, though slightly simpler than either.  I actually like it
better as a generic system than <cite>True20</cite>, though <cite>True20</cite> has the
advantage of simpler character creation.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about running a fantasy campaign with <cite>M&amp;M</cite>.  I think
I'd like it better to play than <cite>D&amp;D</cite>, although the prep work in
creating everything from scratch is a bit of a drawback.  <cite>Wizards &amp;
Warriors</cite>, while useful, doesn't really provide enough to eliminate
the prep work.</p>
</section></section><section id="ramblings"><h2>Ramblings</h2>
<p>For a list of other roleplaying games that I'm interested in you can
look at my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.accessdenied.net/">Access Denied</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.accessdenied.net/cgi-bin/profile?198">profile</a>; my handle there
is “T. Kurt Bond”.</p>
<p>As time has gone by, I've noticed that my tastes in roleplaying games
have broadened from the relatively complicated (<cite>GURPS</cite>) to the
relatively simple (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html">Story Engine</a>). This is
probably due to the decrease in the amount of time I have to devote to
fiddling with rules. At the same time, my tastes in background
material have changed from relatively simple backgrounds (<cite>Greyhawk</cite>)
to backgrounds with more depth (<cite>Glorantha</cite>, <cite>Tékumel</cite>). I still
enjoy games like <cite>GURPS</cite> when I have time for the details, but when I
don't I'm happy with games like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fudgerpg.com/">Fudge</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html">Story Engine</a>.  More
recently, they've swung to the middle ground, to systems like <cite>Savage
Worlds</cite>.</p>

<li><p>Advocacy.  I'm also interested in how society at large regards
roleplaying games and in their social effects. Some information on
this is available from the unoffical <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theescapist.com/carpga.htm">CAR-PGa</a> site.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Web Forums.  I find Web Forums much more painful to read than
newsgroups, but I understand why most online discourse on roleplaying
games has moved shifted to that medium.</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>Online Magazines</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Steve Jackson Games' <a class="reference external" href="http://pyramid.sjgames.com/login/">Pyramid</a>
is the best on-line gaming magazine I've found, and it's well worth
the yearly subscription. It's a weekly magazine that covers all of
Steve Jackson's games, but also has a good selection of articles for
other games and for non-game-specific roleplaying. It also has a very
high quality set of web forums that are (<em>Joy!</em>) also available as
newsgroups for NNTP access.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://ptgptb.org/">Places to Go, People to Be</a> always has an

</ul></section><section id="nostalgia"><h2>Nostalgia</h2>
<p>On Saturday, 11 September 1999, I played my first game of <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>, 2nd
edition. It was fun, in a nostalgic sort of way. I have to admit that
I won't be running any campaigns using it, but I was glad to find out
it was still fun, and I'd certainly play it if I knew good group
playing it.</p>
<p>On Saturday, 4 December 1999, I played my first game of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/tandt.htm">T&amp;T</a> in many years. I found it
to be even more fun than playing <cite>AD&amp;D</cite>, and <em>much</em> simpler. I may
actually run some hack-n-slash games with it.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2006 I played my first game of <cite>D&amp;D</cite> 3rd edition; it was
probably in August. It was fun, and lead to playing <cite>D&amp;D</cite> and <cite>Star Wars
D20</cite> regularly, and to buying the core books and a number of D20
supplements.</p>
</section><section id="old-school"><h2>Old School</h2>
<p>I'm coming to have a greater appreciation for some of what's called
“Old School” gaming: classic <cite>BD&amp;D</cite> and <cite>AD&amp;D</cite> modules, Judges Guild
modules like <cite>Dark Tower</cite> and <cite>Tegel Manor</cite> and supplements like <cite>City
State of the Invincible Overlord</cite> and <cite>Wilderlands of High Fantasy</cite>.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed playing <cite>Labyrinth Lord</cite> and <cite>Swords &amp; Wizardry</cite>
with the kids.  We've run through numerous short adventures (sometimes
with one of the kids as the Labyrinth Lord), and I've run a campaign
for the kids using <cite>Labyrinth Lord</cite> and eventually the <cite>Advanced
Edition Companion</cite> that started in <cite>B2 — Keep on the Borderland</cite>, ran
through the <cite>Swords &amp; Wizardry</cite> version of <cite>The Spire of Iron and
Crystal</cite>, and ran through I3, I4, and I5.  (The kids were glad to be
out of the desert at last when I5 ended. :)</p>
</section><section id="out-of-print-games"><h2>Out of Print Games</h2>
<p>I have a lot of out-of-print games, and I'd play most of them again
anytime. There is one problem with out of print games, though: when
you are playing one with someone new to gaming, and they are really
enjoying it and turn to you and say, “This is great! Where can I get
a copy?” and you have to say, “Well, this game is out of print;
you <em>might</em> be able to find it at one of the online used game and book
stores...” I had this happen to me when I was playing Chaosium's
<cite>Prince Valiant</cite> with my nephew and one of his friends. Sure, if you
are an adult and used to dealing with online gaming stores, you can
often track down a copy, but for someone who is just getting started
in the hobby, especially a child or teenager, it's a lot more
difficult. So now when I know there is going to be a player in the
game who is new to the hobby I try to stick to games that are in
print, just in case.</p>
</section><section id="roleplaying-with-kids"><h2>Roleplaying with Kids</h2>
<p>I regularly run roleplaying games with my daughter and her cousins, at
ages ranging from 6 years to 15 years and above and occasionally as
low as 4 years old. They enjoy it, and the out-of-state cousins always
want to play when they visit.  Some of the kids GM occasionally, which
is lots of fun.</p>
</section><section id="other-games"><h2>Other Games</h2>
<p>I've also been known to play <a class="reference external" href="other-games.html">other games</a> on
occasion.</p>
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-1" role="note"><span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#footnote-reference-1">1</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>When I originally wrote this, I hadn't seen much anime. Now I
have, and I actually like a fair amount of it. <cite>BESM</cite> probably
encouraged me in that direction.</p>
</aside><aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-2" role="note"><span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#footnote-reference-2">2</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Complete meaning that it includes all the rules you need to create
characters and play. It lacks many of the elaborations of the full
Story Engine.</p>
</aside><aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-3" role="note"><span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#footnote-reference-3">3</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>Not to be confused with the popular board game <cite>Heroquest</cite>.</p>
