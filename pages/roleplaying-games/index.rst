Roleplaying Games have been described as “Let's Pretend with
Rules” or “Improvisational Radio Theater”.

I enjoy playing Roleplaying Games (RPG), both as a GamesMaster and a
player, although I don't get to do either as much as I'd like. For a
long time I was the the only one in my gaming group foolish or
enlightened enough to GM, so I rarely got to play. Luckily, that
changed, and the group I'm currently playing with has a couple of good
GMs.

What are Roleplaying Games?
---------------------------

If you've wandered into the conversation in the middle, and are
wondering what roleplaying games are, here is a good `introduction
<http://www.microtactix.com/whatrpg.htm>`_.



How I got started
-----------------

My introduction to roleplaying games was the Christmas present from my
parents of the Holmes Basic `D&D` boxed set. Soon thereafter I was
playing `AD&D` with my brother's friends from high school, and a
little later I was DungeonMastering myself. My gaming group ran across
`Traveller`, but were still focused on fantasy and didn't pursue
it. We also ran across Tunnels and Trolls, and had fun with
it.

Sometime in the mid-1980s I borrowed a copy of `DragonQuest`, and
found its flexibility so attractive I had to buy my own copy, and was
soon running `DragonQuest` games, including the classic SPI adventure
`The Enchanted Wood`. Sometime in the mid-1980's I stopped playing `D&D`
and `AD&D` entirely (thus almost missing out on `AD&D` 2nd edition
completely); At some time after this I found a copy of 2nd edition
`GURPS`, and then 3rd edition, and started using it for most of my
roleplaying games.

I tried a lot of other game systems, but unfortunately the game stores
in my area usually didn't carry much beyond TSR's products, and if
they carried anything else they rarely carried anything except the
core rules. So, for instance, I found `RuneQuest` (3rd edition), but
never any Glorantha supplements, so I didn't really learn anything
about Glorantha until running across it on USENET news groups and
the Internet years later.



Some Interesting Roleplaying Games
----------------------------------

Some RPGs I enjoy are the following (in no particular order):


Prince Valiant
..............

`Prince Valiant`, Greg Stafford's 1989 game from chaosium based on
Hal Foster's legendary Sunday cartoon strips, is the idea game for
introducing folks to roleplaying games: it has simple rules, clear
presentation, a setting that is known to almost everybody, and a
number of short adventures included in the book makes it easy to pick
up and play anytime, and easy for new players to understand. Too bad
it is out of print. (This, by the way, was the original “Story
Telling Game”.) `Pendragon`, Stafford's next Arthurian game, is a
wonderful game for the confirmed gamer, but doesn't serve as well as
an introductory game.

GURPS
.....

`GURPS <http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/>`_, by `Steve Jackson
Games <http://www.sjgames.com>`_, the Generic Universal
Roleplaying System, is particularly well supported with sourcebooks.

I've been following GURPS since the 2nd edition days, and have over
150 GURPS books.  Oddly enough, I haven't bought anything for 4th
edition GURPS except `GURPS Traveller: Interstellar Wars`.  I guess
the two-volume basic set turned me off, and I'm using simpler
systems these days, anyway.  I suppose I'll get back to GURPS
eventually.

2017 Update: I backed the kickstarter for Steve Jackson Games `Dungeon
Fantasy Roleplaying Game <http://www.sjgames.com/dungeonfantasy/>`_ (DFRPG),
and it prompted an interest in GURPS 4th Edition.  I now have the
Basic Set, and several of the other books.  DFRPG looks good.

Bunnies & Burrows
.................

I had never seen the original `Bunnies & Burrows` game, but I bought
the GURPS version, written by Steffan O'Sullivan, and absolutely loved
it.  This was the setting I used in the first RPG sessions I did with the
kids in the family, though I used the Fudge RPG system, also written
by Steffan O'Sullivan.  I was finally able to buy a PDF of the
original `Bunnies & Burrows` game over the Internet in 2011.

CORPS
.....

`CORPS <http://www.btrc.net/html/catalog/catmain.html#CORPS>`_,
the Complete Omniversal Roleplaying System by `BTRC
<http://www.btrc.net/>`_, a terse and elegant generic roleplaying
system.

Elric! & Stormbringer
.....................

`Elric! <http://www.chaosium.com/elric/index.shtml>`_ by
`Chaosium <http://www.chaosium.com/>`_ (and `Stormbringer`, its
predecessor and now (2001) it's successor as well), along with its
companion games `Corum <http://www.darcsyde.org/corum/>`_ and the
past and future `Hawkmoon <http://www.darcsyde.org/hawkmon/>`_.
Here's some thoughts on why to `game <elric-gaming.html>`_ in the
`world <elric-books.html>`_ of `Elric`.

Fudge
.....

`Fudge <http://www.fudgerpg.com/>`_, written by `Steffan
O'Sullivan <http://www.panix.com/~sos/>`_ and a host of USENET
posters in the early 1990s and originally published in book form by
`Grey Ghost Games <http://www.fudgerpg.com/>`_ and now by many
publishers, is `both <fudge.html>`_ a complete roleplaying game for
those who like free-form rules-light games *and* a construction kit
for building your own custom roleplaying game for those who prefer
something more crunchy.  There is a community-maintained `Guide to Fudge
<http://www.fudgerpg.info/>`_ that is a distillation of of the wisdom
of the `Fudge Mailing List
<http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Guide/FudgeList>`_. Steffan
has his `own Fudge page <http://www.panix.com/~sos/fudge.html>`_ with
a lot of designer notes and links to other Fudge pages.

Epiphany
........

`Epiphany
<http://www.btrc.net/html/catalog/catmain.html#Epiphany>`_ by `BTRC
<http://www.btrc.net/>`_, a deceptively simple dice-less fantasy
roleplaying game. (I have a short `description of epiphany <epiphany.html>`_ of
it).

Call of Cthulhu
...............

`Call of Cthulhu <http://www.chaosium.com/cthulhu/index.shtml>`_
by `Chaosium <http://www.chaosium.com/>`_, is a classic horror
roleplaying game set in the worlds of H.P. Lovecraft's stories.

WFRP
....

`WFRP <wfrp.html>`_

DragonQuest
...........

`DragonQuest <link://slug/dragonquest-and-i>`_, originally published by SPI.

Space: 1889
...........

`Space: 1889 <http://www.heliograph.com/space-1889/>`_, by Frank
Chadwick, the original steampunk roleplaying game, was originally
published by Games Designers Workshop and has been republished by
`Heliograph, Inc <http://www.heliograph.com>`_. (I have a short
`description of Space 1889 <space-1889.html>`_).

Big Eyes, Small Mouth
.....................

`BESM <http://www.guardiansorder.on.ca/>`_ (`Big Eyes, Small
Mouth`) from `Guardians of Order`_, an anime RPG, is a good game even
for those who aren't really anime fans. [1]_ The second edition is
especially good, giving you a lite, flexible system that works
reasonably well from normal humans to over-the-top superheros, as
well as integrated robot/mecha/vehicle and magic design systems. If
someone asked me to recommend a good universal roleplaying game that
was simpler than the `Hero System <http://www.herogames.com/>`_
from Hero Games, better at high-power levels than `CORPS`, and complete in one book (unlike
`GURPS`), I'd say `BESM` would be a good choice. `Tri-Stat dX`,
released in July 2003, looks like a fairly comprehensive synthesis
of `BESM` and Guardians superhero game, SAS. dX is a bit crunchier
than `BESM`, and is completely generic (without the anime trappings
of `BESM`), but at 10$US for the printed version and free for the
PDF it's definitely a great value. I hope this does well for
Guardians. Personally, though, I was glad that Guardians still
supported `BESM`, since the addition of PMV s to `Tri-Stat dX` adds
just enough extra complexity to the base system to turn some people
off. I don't think it's actually that much more complicated, but it
certainly gives that appearance.  `BESM`'s more-or-less
effects-based powers system is pretty flexible, but the
effects-based paradigm takes some getting used to; I remember being
surprised and delighted when I learned that in `BESM` a `AD&D`-like
thief backstab ability is something that you build with the standard
`Weapon Attack` attribute with a couple of weapon disabilities. This
system does seem to work well for anime-type characters, who may all
have weird and unique powers. Mostly things are well defined, like
Weapon Attack, but there are a few places where things are a lot
more fuzzy. Overall it works pretty well, and is much simpler than
`Hero`.

`Big Eyes, Small Mouth, 3rd edition <http://www.white-
wolf.com/besm/>`_ was published by the `White Wolf <http://www.white-
wolf.com/>`_ division `Arthaus <http://www.white-
wolf.com/arthaus/index.php>`_ division after `Guardians of Order`_
ceased operations, and I got my copies on 2007/01/30. On a brief but
reasonably complete scan it looks like a good further development of
`BESM` 2nd edition, gaining the benefits of the various Tri-Stat
implementations while becoming only a little more complex, with
options to reduce the complexity to about that of 2nd edition or
perhaps even a little less. It is compatible in philosophy and spirit
to the earlier editions, but characters are not directly
compatible. It made me want to play it when I read it, which is always
a good test. Except for that fact that it is already (at the end of
2007; at least it is still available in PDF) out of print I can't see
why I'd want to use Hero or GURPS instead of BESM third edition unless
there was already an exceedingly well-written supplement for a
particular setting, genre, or campaign that I particularly wanted to
use. There were some minor errata in the first printing, and the
author (and former proprietor of `Guardians of Order`_) Mark C. Mackinnon
made the `corrections
<http://guardiansorder.livejournal.com/19955.html>`_ available.

Story Engine
............

`Story Engine
<http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html>`_, 2nd Edition by
`Hubris Games <http://www.hubrisgames.com/>`_, used for their science
fantasy setting `Maelstrom`. The game is dice and mechanics light and,
as you might expect from the title, focuses more on the dramatic
aspects of roleplaying than the simulationist or gamist aspects.  The
stripped-down but complete [2]_ version, `Story Bones <hubris-
games.html#local-story-bones>`_, used to be available for `download
<http://www.hubrisgames.com/pdf/bones.pdf>`_ at their giveway `page
<http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/giv.html>`_ along with a lot of
other Maelstrom/Story Engine material, but the Hubris Games site
unfortunately disappeared some time in 2003. I make some of those
materials, including Story Bones, available `here <hubris-games.html>`_.
`Precis Intermedia Gaming <http://www.pigames.net/>`_
now sells `PDFs and physical books
<http://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=62>`_ of the `Story
Engine <http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html>`_ and
`Maelstrom Storytelling` lines. Yay!

Castle Falkenstein
..................

`Castle Falkenstein <http://www.talsorian.com/cfindex.shtml>`_
by R. Talsorian Games (and the `GURPS version
<http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/castlefalkenstein/>`_).

Glorantha, HeroQuest
....................

`Issaries, Inc.'s <http://www.glorantha.com/inc/>`_ `Glorantha
<http://www.glorantha.com/>`_ products, including the RPG
`HeroQuest <http://www.glorantha.com/hw/>`_ [3]_
and it's predecessor `Hero Wars`.

Tékumel
.......

Professor M.A.R. Barker's complex science-fantasy world, `Tékumel
<http://www.tekumel.com/>`_, while heavily influenced by non-European
cultures, is its own unique setting. On February 23, 2001 `Guardians
of Order`_ `announced
<http://web.archive.org/web/20010303235049/http://www.guardiansorder.on.ca/022301.html>`_
that they'd be publishing a new Tékumel game, `Tékumel: Empire of the
Petal Throne`. As will surprise no fan of Tékumel, it's turned out to
be a complicated project, and it has been delayed several times. The
good news is that both `Guardians of Order` and the Tékumel experts who
are writing the game are committed to a quality product `Guardians of
Order`_ finally released its
`Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne` roleplaying game in late
February of 2005, and it is *good*.

The Dying Earth
...............

`The Dying Earth <http://www.dyingearth.com/>`_ RPG, based on the
:series:`Dying Earth` novels by Jack Vance and published by Pelgrane Press
is a delightfully quirky game that fits the world of the novels
perfectly.  Alas, Pelgrane decided to stop publishing the game in
April 2009.

Skyrealms of Jorune
...................

`Skyrealms of Jorune <http://www.jorune.org/>`_, created by
Andrew Leker and Miles Teves in the early 1980s, was an extremely
detailed science-fantasy roleplaying game that went through three
editions and sadly is currently out of print. It used the slogan
“Leave your world behind”. There is a `Jorune mailing list
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jorune/>`_

Talislanta
..........

`Talislanta <http://www.talislanta.com/>`_, created by Stephan
Michael Sechi in 1987, is an exotic, quirky, fantasy roleplaying game
somewhat influenced by Jack Vance's fantasy novels. It avoided
the European cultural and mythological cliches at the base of so many
fantasy worlds, and used the slogan “No Elves” in one of its best
remembered ads. It was republished in a fourth edition by `Shooting
Iron <http://www.shootingiron.com>`_ in July 2001, and the first
print run of 1600 copies sold out in only two months. The second
printing became available sometime around November or `December
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/talislanta-l/message/19643>`_ 2002.
There is an active `talislanta mailing list
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/talislanta-l/>`_.
A fifth edition was published by `Morrigan Press <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrigan_Press>`_. 


Nobilis
.......

`Nobilis` is R. Sean Borgstrom's roleplaying game of Sovereign Powers,
the personfications of aspects of reality, such as Pain, Love, Nights,
or Books. Orignally published by Pharos Press and later in an expanded
second edition by `Hogshead
<http://www.hogshead.demon.co.uk/Nobilis_index.htm>`_, the second
edition is now now published by `Guardians of Order`_, which hopes to
publish additional supplements for it in the future.

Savage Worlds
.............

`Savage Worlds` is `Pinnacle Entertainment Group
<http://www.peginc.com/>`_'s “Fast! Furious! Fun!” generic RPG.
I'd read about it and looked at the Test Drive several times, but it
hadn't really clicked for me until I read grubman's `101 days of
Savage Worlds <http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=207839>`_ of
2005-07-26 on rpg.net. I got the revised version in late 2005 and was
delighted by its mix of simplicity, versatility, and moderate tactical
detail. 


`Savage Worlds` is designed for folks who want something that is easy to
prepare for and easy and fast to run, and I think it suceeds at these
goals very well. Characters start off competent and get better, but
are never invulnerable. The core rulebook works well for fantasy,
science fiction, historical, and pulp-level heroics and horror. It is
not super detailed, concentrating on low overhead. The core rulebook
is very complete, containing everything you need to play, including a
nifty mass combat system, vehicle rules, a sampling of creatures, and
so forth. It is well supported, with a line of interesting
setting/campaign books (fantasy, fantasy pirates, super-villains,
weird wild west) and a number of good PDF adventures (zombies,
fantasy, 1930s, TV parody, Kids in Idyllic England), and there are
third-party publishers who also produce for it, as well as a sizable
fan community. 


I've been playing `Savage Worlds` with my daughter and her cousins
(occasionally with my brothers mixed in) and it has gone very well. I
started out by playing a lot of short adventures, then ran
`Evernight`, a fantasy campaign.  To compare it to `Big Eyes,
Small Mouth`, it has simpler character generation, more tactical
options in combat, but actually less bookkeeping during combat. `BESM`
has a more flexible powers/magic system, but `Savage Worlds`
powers/magic system works well for most things, and can be easily
expanded.

I've also played a number of `Savage Worlds` one-shots with my D&D
gaming group, when the regular D&D game couldn't run for one reason or
another.

Dungeons and Dragons
....................

`D&D` is where I got my start, but I moved away from it during the
ending of the `AD&D` years. At that time I was looking for something
with more verisimilitude and detail and less arbitrary restrictions.
To be honest, I was sick of `D&D` and that colored my reactions for
years afterwards. 

I've since come to see the pros as well as the cons of `D&D`, and
though it's not my favorite RPG I can deal with it much better these
days.  

The `D&D` `Rules Cyclopedia` is an amazing feat: one book that
encapsulates the best of traditional `D&D` in an amazingly complete
package. This book makes me wish I'd run or played Basic/Expert/RC
`D&D`. I've since found that several of the Basic/Expert `D&D` modules
are classics (thank goodness for inexpensive PDFs of out-of-print
games!), and the combination is almost enough to prompt me to run a
few RC `D&D` games. Almost. (Maybe I'll run a `Savage Worlds` game
using those modules.)

First edition `AD&D` has a quirky charm that 2nd edition lacks,
perhaps largely due to Gygax's odd but educational writing
style. Reading later editions of `D&D` puts me to sleep in only a few
pages, but even when I'm confused by Gygax's prose it never puts me to
sleep.

On the other hand, 2nd edition `AD&D` is definitely easier to understand.

Third edition `D&D` and the more-or-less minor update 3.5E `D&D` are
very well *designed* and designed very *tightly*, but they're not the
first game I'd reach for when I wanted to play something. Mechanically
they are more complicated and less flexible than I prefer at this
point in my life (although much more flexible mechanically than 1st or
2nd editions), and they encode a great number of things in the core
rules that I'd prefer to leave out. Many of these things make `D&D`
characters seem less real to me: it's hard to squeeze a real character
into a “1st level rogue”. On the other hand, for the type of game-play
for which they are designed, they're excellent, and I'd not hesitate
to play in a 3rd or 3.5th edition campaign. And while I'd not prefer
not to write my own campaign from scratch (3.0E and 3.5E stat blocks
are things of horror) I've happily run one from prewritten modules.

4th edition looks interesting, mechanically. It looks like it has been
tightly focus on making all the base classes much more fun to play in
the tactical battlemap-and-miniatures mode. Unfortunately, it also
seems to have shifted entirely to supporting gamist play, leaving
nowhere for simulationist play. As for the fluff and fluff related
mechanics, such as the selection of races and classes and the changes
to alignment, I'm quite displeased. I finally played 4E in 2009, and
while it is fun for the type of game for which it was designed, it has
a much more narrowed focus than earlier editions.

Tunnels & Trolls
................

`Tunnels & Trolls`, also know as `T&T` is another early RPG that is
a lot of fun.

Hero
....

I bought a number of `Hero` books in the 4th edition days, and have
the 5th edition `Sidekick` (a marvelous distillation of the system),
and like the infinite customizability of the system, but it's a bit
more complicated than I've felt I could get my players to swallow.  I
keep thinking I should pick up the main core rulebook and some of the
genre books, but haven't got around to it yet.

Mutants & Masterminds, 2E and True20
....................................

Two of the many good things to come out of the D20 era are Green
Ronin's OGL game `Mutants & Masterminds` and it's cousin `True20` .  I
have the second edition of `M&M`, and while I haven't played it yet, I
think it would be a wonderful generic system along the lines of `Hero`
and `GURPS`, though slightly simpler than either.  I actually like it
better as a generic system than `True20`, though `True20` has the
advantage of simpler character creation.

I keep thinking about running a fantasy campaign with `M&M`.  I think
I'd like it better to play than `D&D`, although the prep work in
creating everything from scratch is a bit of a drawback.  `Wizards &
Warriors`, while useful, doesn't really provide enough to eliminate
the prep work.


Ramblings
---------

For a list of other roleplaying games that I'm interested in you can
look at my `Access Denied <http://www.accessdenied.net/>`_ `profile
<http://www.accessdenied.net/cgi-bin/profile?198>`_; my handle there
is “T. Kurt Bond”.

As time has gone by, I've noticed that my tastes in roleplaying games
have broadened from the relatively complicated (`GURPS`) to the
relatively simple (`Story Engine
<http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html>`_). This is
probably due to the decrease in the amount of time I have to devote to
fiddling with rules. At the same time, my tastes in background
material have changed from relatively simple backgrounds (`Greyhawk`)
to backgrounds with more depth (`Glorantha`, `Tékumel`). I still
enjoy games like `GURPS` when I have time for the details, but when I
don't I'm happy with games like `Fudge <http://www.fudgerpg.com/>`_
and `Story Engine
<http://www.hubrisgames.com/html/storyengbook.html>`_.  More
recently, they've swung to the middle ground, to systems like `Savage
Worlds`. 



Some things I've done
---------------------

I've made some `roleplaying game materials <rpg-materials.html>`_
from my campaigns available.

I used to run a Swiki for my local gaming group to use for discussions
and records, and a mailing list that was mostly used for scheduling
games.

I have written down some `incoherent thoughts on various matters`__
pertaining to roleplaying games.

__ rpg-debates.html



Some Things Others Have Done
----------------------------

I've got some `archives <rpg-archive.html>`_ of material that was
available for download elsewhere, but has unfortunately disappeared
from the web.



Some Resources
--------------

The following are some roleplaying game resources that I particularly
recommend.


+ Newsgroups:

  + `rec.games.frp.advocacy <news:rec.games.frp.advocacy>`_ is an
    intermittently lively forum for the discussion of the theory and
    practice of roleplaying games.
  + `rec.games.frp.misc <news:rec.games.frp.misc>`_ continues to be a
    frequently visited forum for everything pertaining to roleplaying in
    general.
  + `rec.games.frp.gurps <news:rec.games.frp.gurps>`_ is devoted to
    `GURPS`.

+ Advocacy.  I'm also interested in how society at large regards
  roleplaying games and in their social effects. Some information on
  this is available from the unoffical `CAR-PGa
  <http://www.theescapist.com/carpga.htm>`_ site.
+ Web Forums.  I find Web Forums much more painful to read than
  newsgroups, but I understand why most online discourse on roleplaying
  games has moved shifted to that medium.

  + `RPG.net's <http://www.rpg.net/>`_ `Roleplaying Open
    <http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=3>`_ forum covers
    general roleplaying much better than any of the general roleplaying
    forums on any of the D/D20 sites. It has a lot of interesting
    discussion, as well as a lot of drivel.
  + `The Forge's forums <http://www.indie-rpgs.com/>`_ emphasize
    independently published RPGs and have a more analytical approach to
    gaming.
  + The `Guardians of Order Message Boards
    <http://www.guardiansorder.com/boards/>`_ were very useful for anyone
    playing BESM, Tri-Stat-dX, or SAS, but are long gone now.
  + `The Masters Council
    <http://www.skyseastone.net/masters/index.php>`_ is a gamesmasters
    Workshop forum, for those who want to learn to be better gamesmasters,
    but doesn't seem to get much traffic.
  + The Pinnacle Entertainment Games `forums
    <http://www.peginc.com/forum/index.php>`_ have a lot of discussion of
    `Savage Worlds` and settings and their licensed games.

+ Online Magazines

  + Steve Jackson Games' `Pyramid <http://pyramid.sjgames.com/login/>`_
    is the best on-line gaming magazine I've found, and it's well worth
    the yearly subscription. It's a weekly magazine that covers all of
    Steve Jackson's games, but also has a good selection of articles for
    other games and for non-game-specific roleplaying. It also has a very
    high quality set of web forums that are (*Joy!*) also available as
    newsgroups for NNTP access.
  + `Places to Go, People to Be <http://ptgptb.org/>`_ always has an
    interesting slant on roleplaying.

Nostalgia
---------

On Saturday, 11 September 1999, I played my first game of `AD&D`, 2nd
edition. It was fun, in a nostalgic sort of way. I have to admit that
I won't be running any campaigns using it, but I was glad to find out
it was still fun, and I'd certainly play it if I knew good group
playing it.

On Saturday, 4 December 1999, I played my first game of `T&T
<http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/tandt.htm>`_ in many years. I found it
to be even more fun than playing `AD&D`, and *much* simpler. I may
actually run some hack-n-slash games with it.

Sometime in 2006 I played my first game of `D&D` 3rd edition; it was
probably in August. It was fun, and lead to playing `D&D` and `Star Wars
D20` regularly, and to buying the core books and a number of D20
supplements.



Old School
----------

I'm coming to have a greater appreciation for some of what's called
“Old School” gaming: classic `BD&D` and `AD&D` modules, Judges Guild
modules like `Dark Tower` and `Tegel Manor` and supplements like `City
State of the Invincible Overlord` and `Wilderlands of High Fantasy`.

I have really enjoyed playing `Labyrinth Lord` and `Swords & Wizardry`
with the kids.  We've run through numerous short adventures (sometimes
with one of the kids as the Labyrinth Lord), and I've run a campaign
for the kids using `Labyrinth Lord` and eventually the `Advanced
Edition Companion` that started in `B2 — Keep on the Borderland`, ran
through the `Swords & Wizardry` version of `The Spire of Iron and
Crystal`, and ran through I3, I4, and I5.  (The kids were glad to be
out of the desert at last when I5 ended. :)



Out of Print Games
------------------

I have a lot of out-of-print games, and I'd play most of them again
anytime. There is one problem with out of print games, though: when
you are playing one with someone new to gaming, and they are really
enjoying it and turn to you and say, “This is great! Where can I get
a copy?” and you have to say, “Well, this game is out of print;
you *might* be able to find it at one of the online used game and book
stores...” I had this happen to me when I was playing Chaosium's
`Prince Valiant` with my nephew and one of his friends. Sure, if you
are an adult and used to dealing with online gaming stores, you can
often track down a copy, but for someone who is just getting started
in the hobby, especially a child or teenager, it's a lot more
difficult. So now when I know there is going to be a player in the
game who is new to the hobby I try to stick to games that are in
print, just in case.



Roleplaying with Kids
---------------------

I regularly run roleplaying games with my daughter and her cousins, at
ages ranging from 6 years to 15 years and above and occasionally as
low as 4 years old. They enjoy it, and the out-of-state cousins always
want to play when they visit.  Some of the kids GM occasionally, which
is lots of fun.



Other Games
-----------

I've also been known to play `other games <other-games.html>`_ on
occasion.

.. [1] When I originally wrote this, I hadn't seen much anime. Now I
   have, and I actually like a fair amount of it. `BESM` probably
   encouraged me in that direction.

.. [2] Complete meaning that it includes all the rules you need to create
   characters and play. It lacks many of the elaborations of the full
   Story Engine.

.. [3] Not to be confused with the popular board game `Heroquest`.
