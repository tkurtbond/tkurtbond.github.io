What I write about
------------------

Random musings about books, computers, tabletop role-playing games, and
miscellaneous bits.

Tools I use to write 
--------------------

All the text is written using Emacs_ in reStructuredText_ and
formatted by Docutils_.  The blog software used to be PyBloxsom_, but
after a hiatus, I've moved everything to Nikola_.

* Emacs_ is still the best editor that I've found.  

* reStructuredText_ hits the sweet spot between simple text markup on
  the one hand and well structured and good looking output in a
  multitude of formats on the other hand.

* PyBloxsom_ worked well enough for my needs, but it was a little
  slow, probably the fault of how I had set it up.  When I stopped
  maintaining a webhost on the Internet I went into hiatus.

* I've moved on to Nikola_, a static site generator.  All the text is
  still written in reStructuredText, and all the posts and pages from
  the first blog are again available.
