Alusia
======

I intermittently GamesMastered a campaign set in in a modified version
of SPI's `Frontiers of Alusia` from 1985 to December 1994.  As time
went by the players and I dispersed geographically and acquired more
responsibilities, so we did not play as much in that time as one might
first expect.

This was originally (of course) using the 
:doc:`DragonQuest <dragonquest>` rules from SPI, but when I started playing
`GURPS` I eventually changed to using it for this campaign.

A few years ago, while writing a new adventure for the campaign, I got
`ambitious <notes#why>`__ and from my notes wrote a 55 page (5.5
by 8.5 inches booklet size) campaign history.  Some time ago
(1995/11/9) I converted created a hypertext version (using `Unroff
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~net/unroff/>`__) and added
(1996/1/21) the last two adventures (although in very rough form) and
created an on-line permuted index.  (These are not available any more.)

Most recently, in December 2007, I finally finished a new
`DocBook-based <http://www.docbook.org/whatis>`__ version (which was
also available as a single html file and as a PDF file that includes
some some additional information and reflections.  It was fun to
revisit the campaign. (These too are not available any more.)

In December 2009 I made a minor revision to the DocBook version,
available in several HTML pages, a single HTML page, and a PDF file
(Among other things, this cleaned up the text encoding of the HTML
output.) (These too are not available any more.)

Finally, in November 2019 I converted the document to DocBook 5.  The
results are available as a `HTML file </partyhist.html>`_ and a `PDF
File </partyhist.pdf>`_.
