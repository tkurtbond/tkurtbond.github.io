<h3>The Really Distant Past</h3>
<p>I used to build this collection of pages largely from a single
SGML/XML document (expressed as several separate files) using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">Jade</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://nwalsh.com/">Norm Walsh</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://nwalsh.com/website/">Website DTD</a>
and his <a class="reference external" href="http://nwalsh.com/website/dsssl/">Website Stylesheet</a>, a
customization of the DSSSL <a class="reference external" href="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/">DocBook Stylesheet</a> for HTML.  There are a few links
to legacy HTML pages.</p>
<p>I liked building these pages from XML using DSSSL for a number of
reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It ensured that all the internal links are correct.</p></li>
<li><p>It automatically built navigation tools and a site map.</p></li>
<li><p>It was a good excuse to use XML &amp; DSSSL.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I used DSSSL long after the DSSSL stylesheets for the Website DTDs
were no longer maintained because the build process was considerably
simpler than that of the XML/XSLT replacement.  Unfortunately, the
setup I was using stopped working properly when I moved from FreeBSD
4.11 to FreeBSD 6.2, and at the time I didn't have the patience to
figure out what had gone wrong with the variety of FreeBSD pacakges I
was using to build the site.</p>
<p>I had a sort-of blog that was part of the site, which I made by just
having SGML/XML pages in a log directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-distant-past-to-2007-07-31">
<h3>The Distant Past (??? to 2007-07-31?)</h3>
<p>Reluctantly I turned to the currently supported Website DTD and XSL
stylesheets, along with the DocBook DTD and XSL stylesheets they build
upon, along with an XSL processor, <span class="program">xsltproc</span>.  There had
been a number of changes to the DTD, which required many changes to my
website xml files.  Most annoying was that at some point during the
development of the XSL stylesheets for the Website DTD the
organization as a single XML document had been abandoned, and replaced
by a multiple document model that required processing each XML file
separately and maintaining a separate multiple-document database of
linking information.  This meant that instead of including my entities
once in the original master file I had to include them in each and
every xml file.  This also meant that all the internal links I had
used previously had to be replaced with interdocument links using
olink .  Unfortunately, I found that FreeBSD's ports of the Website
DTD and XSL stylesheets and the DocBook XSL Stylesheets were each a
revision behind, which caused linking between documents to not work.
After downloading and installing current copies of these I finally got
things to work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I found that, at least using <span class="program">xsltproc</span>, the
new process using XSL was <em>much</em> slower and more resource intensive:
the old DSSSL-based process took about 2.5 minutes and never exceed 40
megabytes of resident memory, while the new XSL-based process took 20
minutes (on a faster machine) and uses 70 or more megabytes of
resident memory for each file, and during processing the interdocument
link database reaches over 300 megabytes of resident storage.
Admittedly, some of this was due to the change in the Website DTD from
the one document model to the multiple document model, but still it
seems excessive.</p>

<span id="sphinx-built"></span><h3>The Past (2009-04-17 to 2015?)</h3>
<p>I've since switched the source for my website over to
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReStructuredText</a> (ReST) built using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> It's much simpler than
DocBook.  I miss the more structured DocBook approach, and the
checking of cross-references, but ReST has enough structure to be
useful, without having an complicated syntax, and the tools used to
process it are considerably simpler, faster, and more approachable.  I
just wish ReST had nested interpreted text roles and easier subscripts
and superscripts.  I actually use Sphinx to build it, as you can see
at the bottom of each page.  I'm very happy with how simple it is to
maintain now.</p>
<p>I also had a <a class="reference external" href="https://pyblosxom.github.io/">pyBloxsom</a> blog, writing the posts in reStructuredText,
too.</p>

<h3>The Present (2019-11-06)</h3>
<p>I've <a class="reference external" href="../../posts/2019/11/06/converting-my-pybloxsom-blog-into-a-nikola-blog/">switched</a>
over to using <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> to generate the site, and am hosting it at
<a class="reference external" href="https://tkurtbond.github.io">GitHub</a>.  I wrote a script to convert
my <code class="docutils literal">*.rst</code> files to the format that Nikola uses in a few hours and
then spent much more time manually fixing broken internal links. üòÄ
Nikola has much more functionality than I'm currently using.</p>
