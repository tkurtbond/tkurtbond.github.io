Buggin'
=======

*Buggin'*, *The Tiny Game of Big Adventures*, “The World is Big.  You
are Not.  Best of Luck.”  By Todd Downing, copyright 2003 by Deep7.

This is one of the Deep7_ 1PG_ line of games, and `the kids`_ love it.

BESM, aka Big Eyes, Small Mouth
===============================

Guardians of Order published *Big Eyes, Small Mouth* in 1st, 2nd, and
2nd Revised editions; White Wolf's Arthaus imprint later published the
3rd edition when GoO fell upon hard times.  2ER was my favorite
edition.  Complete in one book and simpler than GURPS, it is good for
a broad spectrum of games.  Character creation can be deep, but play
is very simple.


D&D
===

*Dungeons and Dragons*, 3.5E, `Wizards of the Coast`_.

.. _`Wizards of the Coast`: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome

I've had a lot of fun playing 3.5E with `the kids`_, running *The
Sunless Citadel* and playing in *Scourge of the Howling Horde*.

Fudge Bunnies and Burrows
=========================

*Fudge*, written by `Steffan O'Sullivan`_ (with input from
``rec.games.design``) and published by `Grey Ghost Press`_, is what
O'Sullivan, also the author of `GURPS Bunnies and Burrows`_, uses for
*Bunnies and Burrows* `these days`_.  *Fudge* is one of my favorite
games, and I've followed it since the ``rec.games.design`` days, and
have a copy of the original Wild Mule Games edition of *Fudge*.  This
was the first RPG I played with several of the kids.

Savage Worlds
=============

*Savage Worlds: Explorers' Edition*, by Shane Hensley, Paul “Wiggy”
Wade-Williams, Simon Lucas, Joseph Unger, Dave Blewer, Clint Black,
Robin Elliott, Piotr Koryś With “Evil” Mike, “Chaos” Steve, Zeke
Sparkes, Jay & Amy Kyle, Jodi Black, Dirk Ringersma, Randy Mosiondz.
Published by Great White Games DBA `Pinnacle Entertainment Group`_,
Copyright 2007.  The tagline for *Savage Worlds* is “Fast, Furious,
Fun” and it's very appropriate.  The kids love the fiddly bits
(expoloding dice rolls, tokens for bennies, the playing-card based
initiative.

Toon
====

*Toon*, by Greg Costikyan, developed by Warren Spector, edited by
Steve Jackson, cover and illustrations by Kyle Miller, copyright
1984, 1985, 1986, 1991 by Steve Jackson Incorporated.

Toon_ is a cartoon roleplaying game: think Bugs Bunny, the Roadrunner,
and Tom and Jerry.  I've got nearly the entire oeuvre: *Toon* (the
original edition), *Toon — Deluxe Edition*, *Toon Tales*, *Tooniversal
Tour Guide*, and *Toon Ace Catalog*.  It's another game the kids love.
