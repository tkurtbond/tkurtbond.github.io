I call them the kids but they've grown up a lot since I started
playing RPGs with them.  Most of them are adults or near adults now.


Buggin'
=======

*Buggin'*, *The Tiny Game of Big Adventures*, “The World is Big.  You
are Not.  Best of Luck.”  By Todd Downing, copyright 2003 by Deep7.

This is one of the Deep7_ 1PG_ line of games, and `the kids`_ love it.

BESM, aka Big Eyes, Small Mouth
===============================

Guardians of Order published *Big Eyes, Small Mouth* in 1st, 2nd, and
2nd Revised editions; White Wolf's Arthaus imprint later published the
3rd edition when GoO fell upon hard times, and `Dyskami Publishing`_
published a 4th Edition later.  2ER was my favorite edition.  Complete
in one book and simpler than GURPS, it is good for a broad spectrum of
games.  Character creation can be deep, but play is very simple.


D&D 3.5e
========

*Dungeons and Dragons*, 3.5E, `Wizards of the Coast`_.

I've had a lot of fun playing 3.5E with `the kids`_, running *The
Sunless Citadel* and playing in *Scourge of the Howling Horde*.

Fudge Bunnies and Burrows
=========================

*Fudge*, written by `Steffan O'Sullivan`_ (with input from
``rec.games.design``) and published by `Grey Ghost Press`_, is what
O'Sullivan, also the author of `GURPS Bunnies and Burrows`_, uses for
*Bunnies and Burrows* `these days`_.  *Fudge* is one of my favorite
games, and I've followed it since the ``rec.games.design`` days, and
have a copy of the original Wild Mule Games edition of *Fudge*.  This
was the first RPG I played with several of the kids.

Savage Worlds
=============

*Savage Worlds: Explorers' Edition*, by Shane Hensley, Paul “Wiggy”
Wade-Williams, Simon Lucas, Joseph Unger, Dave Blewer, Clint Black,
Robin Elliott, Piotr Koryś With “Evil” Mike, “Chaos” Steve, Zeke
Sparkes, Jay & Amy Kyle, Jodi Black, Dirk Ringersma, Randy Mosiondz.
Published by Great White Games DBA `Pinnacle Entertainment Group`_,
Copyright 2007.  The tagline for *Savage Worlds* is “Fast, Furious,
Fun” and it's very appropriate.  The kids love the fiddly bits
(expoloding dice rolls, tokens for bennies, the playing-card based
initiative.

Toon
====

*Toon*, by Greg Costikyan, developed by Warren Spector, edited by
Steve Jackson, cover and illustrations by Kyle Miller, copyright
1984, 1985, 1986, 1991 by Steve Jackson Incorporated.

Toon_ is a cartoon roleplaying game: think Bugs Bunny, the Roadrunner,
and Tom and Jerry.  I've got nearly the entire oeuvre: *Toon* (the
original edition), *Toon — Deluxe Edition*, *Toon Tales*, *Tooniversal
Tour Guide*, and *Toon Ace Catalog*.  It's another game the kids love.

Labyrinth Lord
==============

`Labyrinth Lord`_ from `Goblinoid Games`_ is a wonderful retro-clone
of B/X D&D, and it's companion `Advanced Edition Companion`_ adds
compatibility with AD&D, which makes it perfect for running the old
modules I have.  It plays much like we actually played AD&D back in
the day, without some of the convolutions.  We had great fun playing
`Keep on the Borderlands` and a number of other modules, and one of
the kids, T.A., ran the module `Idol of the Orcs`_ for us_!

Mini Six
========

I ran several `Mini Six`_ (from `Antipaladin Games`_) Star Wars games
with the kids, and really liked the simple nature of the system.  I
also ran and liked the `Breachworld RPG`_ which uses a slightly
customized `Mini Six`_ rules set.  I also liked its setting, a post
apocalypse caused by too much teleportation, which created Breaches to
other worlds, which then invaded the Earth.  There are several other
games which use the `Mini Six`_ rules set.

D6 Star Wars
============

One of the kids, T.A., was very interested in the Star Wars `Mini
Six`_ game I ran, and that led to him running the original D6 `Star
Wars` roleplaying game several times.
