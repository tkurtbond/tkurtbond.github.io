APPENDIX N: INSPIRATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL READING
=================================================

Inspiration for all of the fantasy work I have done stems directly
from the love my father showed when I was a tad, for he spent many
hours telling me stories he made up as he went along, tales of cloaked
old me who could grant wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords, or
wicked sorcerors and dauntless swordsmen.  Then too, countless
Hundreds of comic books went down, and the long-gone EC ones certainly
had their effect.  Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies were a
big influence.  In fact, all of us tend to get ample helpings of
fantasy when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those written
by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.  This often leads to reading
books of mythology, paging through bestiaries, and consultation of
compilations of the myths of various lands and peoples.  Upon such a
base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all
science fiction and fantasy literature since 1950.  The following
authors were of particular inspiration to me.  In some cases I cite
specific works, in others, I simply recommand all their fantasy
writing to you.  From such sources, as well as just about any other
imaginative writing or screenplay you will be able to pluck kernels
from which grow the fruits of exciting campaigns.  Good reading!

The most immediate influences upon AD&D were probably de Camp & Pratt,
REH, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, HPL, and A. Merrit; but all of the
above authors, as well as many not listed, certainly helped to shape
the form of the game.  For this reason, and for the hours of reading
enjoyment, I heartily recommend the works of these fine authors to
you.
