Doris Piserchia
===============

Doris Piserchia was born in Fairmont, West Virginia in 1928, graduated
from Fairmont State College in 1950, and served in the Navy from 1950
to 1954.  She started writing science fiction while working toward her
Master's Degree in Educational Psychology.

Following is a (perhaps partial) list of her novels; the asterisks (*)
indicate the novels that I have read.


+ `Mister Justice`, 1972, ACE.
+ `Star Rider`, 1974, Bantam Books.*
+ `A Billion Days of Earth`, 1976, Bantam Books.*
+ `Earthchild`, 1977, DAW.*
+ `Spaceling`, 1978, DAW.*
+ `The Fluger`, 1980, DAW.*
+ `The Spinner`, 1980, DAW.* [1]_
+ `Doomtime: The war of the world trees`, 1981, DAW.*
+ `Earth in Twilight`, 1981, DAW.
+ `The Dimensioneers`, 1982, DAW.
+ `Blood County` 1982, DAW, as Curt Selby.
+ `I, Zombie` 1982, DAW, as Curt Selby.
+ `The Deadly Sky`, 1983, DAW.*


I ran across `Spaceling` first (well, maybe [2]_), and from there went
looking for her other works.  Oddly enough, I didn't realize she was
originally from Fairmont until years later in the early 1990s when I
saw it mentioned in the "About the Author" blurb of one of her books I
picked up at a used bookstore.

`Spaceling` is definitely my favorite of her novels.  It is an
entertaining coming-of-age story about Daryl, a 14 year old girl with
amnesia who is one of the few who can see the brightly colored rings
that are dimensional portals and who changes shape when she passes
through those portals.

Several of her novels are set in the far distant future, such as `Star
Rider` and `A Billion Days of Earth`.  `The Spinner` and `The Fluger`
both use the idea of alien creature/being that goes on a rampage and
must be hunted down.

The `Encyclopedia of Science Fiction`__ by John Clute and Peter Nicholls
includes an interesting entry__ on Doris Piserchia.

There are a number of much better pages on Doris Piserchia on the web
these days.  Here's `one
<http://www.digitalmediatree.com/dorispiserchia>`__ that has an
interesting interview with her.  There is also a low volume `mailing

.. [1] I reread this in November 1997, and found it odder than I had
   remembered.  It depicts, among other things, the careless
   destruction of one ecosystem and the rampage of the one surviving
   member of that ecosystem; the plight of the elderly, and one
   moderately successful but unpleasant way of dealing with it; the
   decay of a civic organism when subjected to extreme stress; illegal
   and immoral medical experiments; distrust of the competence of the
   military; and the moral and mental decay of a number of
   individuals.

.. [2] I may have actually run across `Star Rider` earlier, but if so
   I was too young for it to make much of an impression on me.
