Here are some downloads and links for various RPGs.

Big Eyes, Small Mouth

  formatted version of “Table 11-2: Attack Situation Modifiers” and
  “Table 11-3: Defence Situation Modifiers”.
• `Third Edition Page </BESM3E/BESM3_page168.pdf>`_ — Properly
  formatted version of “Table 12-2: Armour”.

BESM Fourth Edition
-------------------

• `Fourth Edition Attributes, Enhancements, Limiters, and Defects
  Summary </BESM4E/4E-ref.pdf>`_
  
OVA: The Anime Role-Playing Game
================================

• `OVA Reference Sheet </OVA/ova-ref.pdf>`_ — Index of page numbers for OVA
  Abilities, Weaknesses, Perks, and Flaws on the first page and useful
  tables and reminders for play on the second.
• `OVA Character Sheet spreadsheet </OVA/OVA-Character-Sheet.ods>`_ —
  Brutally simple LibreOffice spreadsheet.  It does total the levels
  for the Abilities and Weaknesses individually and their sum.
• `OVA Character Sheet PDF </OVA/OVA-Character-Sheet.pdf>`_ — PDF of
  the above for when you need a quick paper character sheet to write
  on with more space than the (much nicer looking) standard OVA
  character sheet.
• `Google Sheets OVA Character Sheet Template
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xsJ1qUruEqumiRa_M8Sm_2N7vuiSJYAuNdFf7f_N6G4/edit?usp=share_link>`_
  — This is a Google Sheets version of an OVA Character Sheet.  It
  calculates total levels of Abilities and Weaknesses and the sum of
  both.  It prints on two pages when using narrow margins.
• `Google Sheets OVA Character Sheet Template PDF
  </OVA/OVA-Charsheet-Template-Google-Sheets.pdf>`_ — PDF of the
  above.  I think the design of this sheet is a bit better than the
  LibreOffice spreadsheet.
