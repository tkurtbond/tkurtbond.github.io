.. _TPK:

TPK
    Total Party Kill.  When the opponents of the player characters end
    up killing all the player characters.  Often unexpected, and sometimes
    blamed on poor understanding by the GM of difficulty level of the
    opponents.

.. _Retro-clone:

Retro-clone
    A new game system that closely emulates an older edition of a game
    system that is out of print in order to compatible with anything
    produced for the older system.  Often, but not always, derived
    from `Open Gaming`__ materials under the `Open Gaming License`__
    (OGL) or similar `public copyright licenses`__.

    `Labyrinth Lord` (LL1_, LL2_, LL3_) and `Old-School Essentials`
    (OSE1_, OSE2_) are retro-clones of B/X D&D (B1_, B2_, X1_, X2_).
    `Swords & Wizardry Complete` (`S&W1`_, `S&W2`_) is a retro-clone
    of `Original D&D`_ plus some additional material from `The
    Strategic Review` and `Dragon` magazines_.  OSRIC_ is a
    retro-clone of `Advanced Dungeons & Dragons`.
