`DragonQuest`_ (`DQ`) was the second roleplaying game I played
seriously.  In junior high school I borrowed it from an acquaintance
of my older brother and devoured it.  When I finally found a copy of
it myself (the paperback of the 2nd edition) I was overjoyed, and
later when a friend of mine had a chance to pick up another copy for
me (the hardback of the 2nd edition) I was also thrilled.  `DQ` was
published by `SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulations_Publications>`__, a prolific
board wargames publisher, and the organization of the book reflected
their wargames heritage, with numbered sections, subsections, and
tables.  It is the sort of text that one has to read completely
through before being able to understand it, since some things were
used before they were defined.  Despite that, when you do read it
through a few times it was readily comprehensible.  (An index would
have made it much, much easier, as would have a contents with actual
pagenumbers!)

A Description of `DragonQuest`
------------------------------

A `DQ` character has six *primary characteristics*: Physical Strength
(PS), Manual Dexterity (MD), Agility (AG), Endurance (EN), Magical
Aptitude (MA) and Willpower (WP), amongst which a randomly determined
number of Characteristic Points are divided.  Furthermore, every `DQ`
character had a number of other *secondary characteristics*, most of
which were calculated based on the primary characteristics: Fatigue
(FT), based on Endurance; Perception, which started at a fixed value;
and Tactical Movement Rate (TMR), which was based on Agility.  A `DQ`
character might also have some optional characteristics introduced by
the GM, and one “standard” [#pb]_ optional characteristic is
described in the rules as an example, Physical Beauty (PB).

The player of a `DQ` character can choose the gender of their
character.  Whether the character was left-handed, right-handed, or
ambidextrous is determined randomly.  A player who wants to be a non-
human had chance to roll under a Base Chance for the race they want to
be, and if they fail at the first race they can try again with a
different race, for three chances total.  The playable races are
Dwarves [#dwarves]_, Elves, Giants, Halflings, Humans, Orcs, and Shape-
Changers.  Characters also have an *Aspect*, which is an influence upon
the character based on the time and date of their birth, determined
randomly in an abstract manner, which can increase their chances of
success at various special times, and a *Heritages*, which is the
social status of character, the legitimacy of their birth, and their
birth order.  Finally, a player determines the amount of starting
experience points and money they have and can spend these on initial
skills and equipement, respectively.

`DragonQuest` uses only 10-sided dice: D10s for damage, and D100 for
skills.  `DQ` is skill-based, and the major skills amount to
professions: Alchemist, Assassin, Astrologer, Beast Master, Courtesan,
Healer, Mechanician, Merchant, Military Scientist, Navigator, Ranger,
Spy, Thief, and Troubador.  Each of these gives the character a number
of individual abilities with their success chances figured as a
percentage by individual formulas based on their Rank in the skill.
There was is no disadvantage to having more than one of these
professional skills, other than the fact that the character will have
more skills on which to spend experience points, making each
individual skill advance slower.  There is also a skill for each
weapon, with a percentage chance of success based on the weapon's base
chance to hit and the characater's Rank with that weapon.  Finally,
there are skills for stealth, horsemanship, speaking a language, and
reading and writing a language, all figured with their own individual
formula.

The Combat System is more tactical than that of `AD&D` (perhaps less so
than 3rd edition `D&D`) and is played on a hex grid for tactical
movement and takes into account facing.  Damage is applied to the
Fatigue characteristic first, representing effort made to avoid a more
serious blow, and then to Endurance when all Fatigue is lost,
representing actual physical damage.  Armor reduces damage.  If a Strike
Check roll is 15% or less of what is needed to succeed damage goes
straight to Endurance and is not reduced by Armor.  If a Strike Check
roll is 5% or less of what is needed to succeed, a roll on the
Grievous Injury Table is necessary.  That table has three sections, one
for each weapon class (thrusting, slashing, crushing), and each
section has multiple entries, but the entries for all three sections
are numbered in the same series, so thrusting weapons do a Grievous
Injury on rolls of 01 through 20, slashing weapons do a Grievous
Injury on rolls of 21 through 80, and crushing weapons do a Grievous
Injury on rolls of 70 through 100.  Here is a representative entry:

..
   That's a non-breaking hyphen between the numbers!

:**14‑18**:
	Tsk, tsk.  A wound of the solid viscera.  Usually fatal.  Take 3
	Damage Points to Endurance Immediately and 1 per Pulse thereafter
	until the bleeding is stopped by a Healer of Rank 2 or above or you
	die.  Add 30 to the chance of Infection.

Every character was allowed [#adepts]_ to join a *College of Magic*, thus
becoming an *Adept*, and learn various talents, spells, and rituals,
all of which were skill based.  An Adept learns all the General
Knowledge of his College during his apprenticeship and can learn the
more advanced Special Knowledge later.  Spells cost Fatigue to cast,
have different Base Chances to cast which are modified by various
factors (including Rank) to yield a Cast Chance, and have effects
which are based on the character's Rank with the spell, often figured
with individual formulas based on Rank.

`DQ` has 12 Colleges of Magic in three different Branches of Magic:

+ The Thaumaturgies:

  + The College of Ensorcellments and Enchantments
  + The College of Sorceries of the Mind
  + The College of Illusions
  + The College of Naming Incantations

+ The Elementals:

  + The College of Air Magics
  + The College of Water Magics
  + The College of Fire Magics
  + The College of Earth Magics
  + The College of Celestial Magics

+ The Entities:

  + The College of Black Magics
  + The College of Necromantic Conjurations
  + The College of Greater Summonings

And, of course, there is a Backfire Table to roll on when your Cast
Check is especially bad.  Here is a representative entry:

..
   That's a non-breaking hyphen between the numbers!

:46‑50:
   Your companions may well curse your name for this! The GM
   assigns a number to each character within Range and rolls D10.  The
   character whose number is first rolled is the target of the spell.  If
   no character's number is rolled, the GM rolls again until one
   character's number is rolled.

Producing temporary magic items is easy, since any Adept can learn the
Investment Ritual which could store a number of charges of a
particular spell in an ojbect.  The relatively easily available magic
items, the ubiquity of magic, and the variety of Colleges makes `DQ`
magic very flavorful.

Experience is awarded for each session played, modified by Rank and
possibly by race, doubled if the adventurers succeeded in their goals,
and is spent buying Ranks in skills.  Most non-human race need more
experience points than humans to advance a skill, except for the fast-
living orcs, who need less.  (Experience, thankfully, has nothing to do
with how many monsters the characters killed or how much treasure they
found.) To advance any skill time must be spent training under a more
skilled indivudual, which will usually cost money.

There were some in-game conventions for organizing adventuring
parties, including an actual Adventurers Guild, which would draw up
contracts (the standard contract was included in the rulebook),
arbitrate disputes, and enforce contracts.  These services are free to
a guildmember, and cost a relatively small fee for others.  NPCs
adventurers were expected to be Adventurers Guild members and to
insist on a contract if hired.

The book included a sample adventure, “The Camp of Alla~Akabar”, which
I found very different from the `AD&D` adventures I'd played and run
up to that point.

Reflections
-----------

All in all, it was a very nice system.  Combat could take longer than
`AD&D`, but an experienced group could make things flow quickly, and
the additional tactical detail was attractive to me after the simpler
combat system of `AD&D`.  I think I became dissatisfied with it
because there were so many things that had to be recalculated when
characters gained experience, most using their own unique formulas.
These days there would be a spreadsheet for these things, but at that
time I had to do the calculations manually.  And since I typically
made the important NPCs using the same rules as the PCs, I did a lot
of calculating.  The various formulas were spread through the text,
and sometimes were difficult to find.  (I really should have typed up
a complete summary of all the formulas.)

In looking back at `DQ` while writing these notes, `DQ` still looks
like a fun game.  I can see myself playing in or running another `DQ`
campaign sometime when I have a bit more free time.

Unpleasant History
------------------

Unfortunately SPI was taken over by TSR and `gutted
<http://www.costik.com/spisins.html>`__, (see `also
<http://grognard.com/zines/so/so43.txt>`__) so many of SPI's plans for
`DragonQuest` never came to fruition, such as their expanded magic
supplement, `Arcane Wisdom`, which was written but never published
before SPI's demise.  TSR published just enough `DQ` material to keep
their trademarks valid, including the `DQ1 — The Shattered Statue`,
which was dual statted for both `DQ` and `AD&D` and included some of
the material from the unpublished `Arcane Wisdom`, and a bowdlerized
3rd edition of `DQ`, with the nastier colleges of magic removed and
some of the material for `Arcane Wisdom` added, which I'd never seen
until 2010.

Fans
----

There are a number of `DQ` fan sites, and there have been various fan
efforts to reproduce the DQ rulesbooks in PDF form, sometimes with
house rules integrated.  It is unfortunate that these have always
lacked the permission of the copyright holder, which is now Hasbro,
via their acquisition of Wizards of the Coast, which had acquired TSR.

   A friend picked up a copy of this for me someplace in Ohio.  A lucky
   find, since that meant that we now had two copies of `DQ` for our
   campaign, and it was the hardback, which I didn't have.

   This is the first `DQ` book I owned.  I wish I knew where I found
   it; probably either in West Vriginia, where I lived, or in Ohio,
   where my grandparents lived.

3. `Gamesmaster's Screen`, *Another DragonQuest Accessory*, SPI,
   copyright 1980; 4 panel portrait-oriented folding screen; product
   number 3310.

   There's nothing to indicate who worked on this, but it just
   reprints a number of tables from the main rulebook.

   I used this through most of my `Frontiers of Alusia` campaign__,
   and probably had it before then.

4. `Frontiers of Alusia Adventure Map`, *Another DragonQuest
   Accessory*, by Rudy Kraft (design), Redmond A Simonsen (graphic
   design), David James Ritche (development); Ted Koller, Manfred F.
   Milkuhn, Michael E. Moore, Bob Ryer, Ken Stec (production).  SPI,
   copyright 1981; cover one 11×17 inch sheet of folded cardstock,
   booklet one 11×17 inch sheet of folded paper, map one 33¼×22 inch
   sheet of heavy paper folded to just less than 8½×11 and printed on
   one side.  The 4 8½×11 inch surfaces of the cover had a portion of
   the map on the front, a legend for the map on the back, and general
   description of the area shown on the map and an reprint of the
   “Danger Table” from section [63.1] of the `DQ` rulebook on the two
   inside pages.  The booklet had 4 8½×11 inch pages with entries for
   various places and geographical features on the map with the Terrain
   Type, Danger Level, Encounter Frequency, Encounter Chance, and
   Encounter Table Modification and a paragraph of description.

   I can't figure out how I missed this when I listed the rest of
   these items!  This was probably one of the earlier purchases I made
   for `DQ` after the rulebook and perhaps `The Enchanted Wood`.  While
   it didn't contain much, it provided a starting point for hundreds
   of hours of pondering and nearly as much time gaming.

   I ran a long campaign__ with `The Frontiers of Alusia`, originally
   with `DragonQuest` and later with `GURPS`.

5. `The Palace of Ontoncle`, *DragonQuest Adventure One*, by Peter

   (art production and technical editing); Matthew Quayle (box cover
   illustration).  SPI, copyright 1980; 28 pages, counting front cover and
   back cover; product number 316P11.

   I don't think I ever saw a copy of this in a store back when I was
   playing `DQ`.  I got a copy of it in December 2007 from an internet
   store that deals in out-of-print games.

6. `The Blade of Allectus`, *DragonQuest Adventure Two*, by Nick Karp
   (game design and development); Redmond A. Simonsen (design of physical

   I saw a copy of this in a store in a mall near Beckley, West
   Virginia in the mide 1980s, but as a teenager didn't have enough
   money to buy it, something I bitterly regreted at the time.  I got a
   copy of this in December 2007 from an internet store that deals in
   out-of-print games.

.. _the-enchanted-wood:

7. `The Enchanted Wood`, *DragonQuest Adventure Three*, by Paul
   Jaquays (adventure design); Gerard C. Klug (adventure editing and
   development); Redmond A Simonsen (design of physical systems,
   grahpics, and illustrations); Robert J. Ryer (technical editing and
   development); Manfred F. Milkuhn (art production management); Ed
   Beach, Greg Gordon, Stephen Gray, Robert B. Kern, John Kuhhta, Fred
   Malmberg, Dean Martelle, Tom Stanford, Tony Stanford, and all the
   `DragonQuest` players who participated in the tournaments using
   this adventure at Origins '81, GenCon East, and GenCon XIV
   (adventure testing); Marjorie Gray, Ted Koller, Ken Stec (art
   production); Timothy Truman (cover and interior
   illustrations).  SPI, copyright 1981; 48 pages, counting front cover
   and back cover; product number 3551.

   This was probably the second `DQ` product I owned, and after the
   rulebook it was definitely the best.  For many years it was the
   **only** `DQ` adventure I owned [#dq-in-wv]_.  Paul
   Jaquays [#jaquays]_, as I found out many years
   later [#jaquays-adventures]_, actually published several wonderful
   “present a setting with multiple groups in conflict and interesting
   locations”-style adventures, and `The Enchanted Wood` was his
   effort in this vein for `DQ`.  Like several of the adventures he
   worked on (`Caverns of Thracia` is another example) this was really
   more of a campaign in a box, supporting way more than a simple
   adventure.  I think this was easily the best of the few published
   `DQ` adventures.  Amusingly, although Paul Jaquays learned the
   rules before writing `The Enchanted Wood`, he never actually
   *played* `DQ`.

8. `Arena of Death`

   I'm pretty sure I owned this at one point; I seem to still have the
   tactical map.  If I recall correctly it was a gladitorial game
   based on the combat system from 1st edition `DragonQuest`, or
   perhaps a predecessor to it.

9. `DragonQuest`, 1st edition, boxed set; Eric Goldberg (Game
   Design/Development), Redmond A. Simonsen (Graphic Design), David
   J. Ritchie (Game Development). Copyright 1980, Simulations
   Publication Inc.

   I was amazed at my luck when I found this in a used bookstore in
   Buckhannon, WV, on Saturday, 20 February 2010, and bought it for
   7$US.  The bottom of the box is a bit water-stained, but the
   contents were all there, the chits unpunched.  It was interesting
   to read the combat rules and see how they differed from the 2nd
   edition. 

Judges Guild Products

I got all of the following in December 2007 from an internet store that
deals in out-of-print games.

All three of these are set in SPI's `The Frontiers of Alusia`; I wish
I had owned them when I was running my `The Frontiers of Alusia`
campaign, so I could have mined them for ideas.  They did flesh out the
setting a little bit.

   I'm reasonably certain that I bought this in a store somewhere, in

   date.  Also by Paul Jaquays (and featuring the return of an NPC from
   `The Enchanted Wood`) this dual `AD&D`/ `DQ` adventure and rules
   supplement was too little, too late.

TSR also published a bowdlerized 3rd edition of `DQ`, which I knew
about but never saw until 2010.  It was a subject for controversy and
resentment amongst `DQ` players.

   I bought this in 2010, when I saw it going cheap at an internet
   store that deals in out-of-print games.  It is a 8½×11 paperback
   (with much flimsier covers than the paperback 2nd edition), with a
   cover illustration much less striking than the 2nd edition cover.
   It is printed in black-and-white only, lacking the red headings and
   shadings of the 2nd edition.

   Sometime when I'm feeling resilient I'll site down and read it
   cover to cover and compare it to 2nd edition for differences.
   Sigh. 


.. [#pb] In practice every character had a Physical Beauty score, since it
   was in the rulebook, and indeed a Courtesan character was *required*
   to have a Physical Beauty score.

.. [#dwarves] `DQ`, like most other fantasy roleplaying games, followed
   Tolkien's lead in spelling Dwarves and Elves.

.. [#adepts] Indeed, even encouraged, since there was no cost to join a College
   and no benefit for not joining, other than not having to spread ones
   later experience points over more skills.

.. [#dq-in-wv] My access to `DQ` publications in 1980s West
   Virginia was restricted by the limited stock carried by the local
   stores and the emptiness of my wallet as a teenager, although I did
   see a few of `DQ` products in stores in WV.

.. [#jaquays] Paul Jaquays, now Jennell Jaquays, is a talented artist
   and designer who worked extensively in roleplaying games then moved
   on to computer games.

.. [#jaquays-adventures] I became better acquainted with Paul Jaquays'
   work later through recommendations on the Internet and when some of
   it was reprinted for 3rd edition `D&D` and when `Griffin Mountain`
   was republished as part of the Moon Design Publications Glorantha
   Classics reprints.  Oddly enough, I had read and been intrigued by
   `Griffin Island`, the 3rd edition `RuneQuest` boxed set, when I was
   first buying `RuneQuest 3` material, but had somehow not connected
   Paul Jaquays of `The Enchanted Wood` with it.

   It wasn't until gaming stores selling over the Internet became
   common that I tracked down his other `RuneQuest` adventures and his
   earlier `D&D` adventures from :company:`Judges Guild`.
