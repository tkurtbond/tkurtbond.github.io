Here I'd like to list the typographical conventions I'm currently
using for this blog.  (Earlier posts and pages may not use these
conventions.)

• **Filenames** are a green monospaced font: :file:`/usr/local/bin`.
• **Application names** are a black bold italic: :app:`Emacs`.
• **Command names** (Unix, VMS, Microsoft Windows/DOS, whatever) are a
  black bold monospaced font: :command:`ls` or :command:`emacs` when talking
  about the actual command.
• The names and section numbers of :app:`man` pages are in a
  monospaced italic font :man:`groff_ms(7)`.
• **Inline literal or code** text is a red monospaced font with a gray
  background with a hint of red (``#f9f2f4`` to be precise): ``rm -rfv *``.
• **Key strokes** are in an orange monospaced font with a gray background
  with a hint of red (``#f9f2f4`` again): :key:`C-x C-s`. They are
  notated with the :app:`Emacs` conventions: ``M-`` indicates the Meta
  key (usually "Alt" or "Option" on common keyboards, sometimes
  indicated with ⌥ by Apple, although the Unicode character is ⎇),
  ``C-`` indicates the "Control" key.  ``S-`` indicates the "Super"
  key, ⌘ (“Command”) on Macs, and something else weird on other
  keyboards.

Now for the fun stuff:

  combination thereof) are enclosed in a box with rounded corners:
  :area:`K1`.

  bold: :mech:`Mighty Blow`.

• A **non-player character name**, when notated, is in bold italics:
  :npc:`Neven  Wesved`.
• When a **dead player character** is notated, their name is in bold and
  strikethrough: :deadpc:`Bytor`.
• When a **dead non-player character** is notated, their name is in bold
  italics and strikethrough: :deadnpc:`Polam Wesved`.
• A **creature name**, when notated, is in red and bold:
  :creature:`Carrion Crawler`.
• A **scene name**, when notated, is in italics: :scene:`Across the Chasm`.
• A **GM's name**, when notated, is in underlined, overlined dark
  green: :gm:`T.T.`.
• A **hireling's name**, notated, is in underline: :hire:`Symna` and
  :hire:`Karl`.
• **Experience points** (or **character points**, whatever they are named),
  when notated, are in bold: :xp:`250 xp`.
